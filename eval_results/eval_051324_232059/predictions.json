Amazon.com When it comes to blockbuster franchises, the first sequel frequently offers pumped-up versions of the initial thrills--to diminishing results. Catching Fire , however, the second adaptation drawn from Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games trilogy, defies that trend with more finely drawn relationships. With the 74th Games in the history books, Katniss (Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, as comfortable in warrior garb as in designer couture) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson, better than ever) set out on a victory tour across Panem with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). Despite her best efforts to feign romance with her co-competitor and to keep posttraumatic stress at bay, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fears that Katniss's defiant nature will incite rebellion, so he takes a tip from new gamemaker Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and launches a Quarter Quell in which past champions, such as the hilariously bitter Johanna (Jena Malone) and the deceptively arrogant Finnick (Sam Claflin), will fight to the death. Not all tributes are quite so young, like Mags (Lynn Cohen), a senior citizen who suits up for battle and establishes a touching bond with Finnick (Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer play the craftiest teammates). Until the cliffhanger ending, director Francis Lawrence ( I Am Legend ) serves up an array of splendors, from killer baboons to the ever-amazing outfits of Effie and Caesar (Stanley Tucci). Most significantly, the script from cowriter Simon Beaufoy ( Slumdog Millionaire ) strengthens the bonds between Katniss and Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who prove themselves more worthy than ever of Katniss's affections. --Kathleen C.

To escape her lonely life and troubled relationship with her father (Bettany), Lily flees with Rosaleen (Hudson), her caregiver and only friend, to a South Carolina town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by the intelligent and independent Boatwright sisters (Latifah, Okonedo and Keys), Lily finds solace in their mesmerizing world of beekeeping, honey and the Black Madonna. Amazon.com Headed by an all-star cast of women, The Secret Life of Bees is the heartwarming and well-told story of a young girl who finds love and acceptance from a trio of independent sisters. The Secret Life of Bees is based on the bestselling book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd and centers around the plight of 14-year-old Lily (Dakota Fanning). Assuming the burden for her mother's premature death, she has a precarious relationship with her abusive father T. Ray (Paul Bettany). Lily's only friend is her caregiver Rosaleen (Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson). Set in South Carolina in 1964, when civil rights wasn't a given, Rosaleen's life is threatened by racists who'd just as soon see her dead than exercise her right to vote. Lily runs away with her to a town she believes may hold the secrets of her mother's life. There the pair meet the Boatwright sisters August (Queen Latifah), June (Alicia Keys) and May (Sophie Okonedo)--who produce the area's famous Black Madonna honey. They eventually provide Lily with the unconditional love she never felt she had and also show Rosaleen that being a black woman in the South doesn't mean she can't have a sense of worth. The Secret Life of Bees doesn't try to pass itself off as a historical documentation of race relations in the 1960s. But the fictional slice of life still resonates because of the feelings of injustice that it stirs up. Though the film is written to show the disparity between blacks and whites, there is always a strong sense of hope, thanks to the lead actresses who bring empathy and dignity to their roles. Hudson exhibits some of the same quiet grace that Regina Taylor brought to her role as the family housekeeper in the superb TV series I'll Fly Away . Latifah has the part of wise matriarch down pat, even when she's playing a sister rather than a mother. And it's clear that Fanning is making a seamless transition from kid to young adult roles. Whether she's giving an impassioned monologue or listening thoughtfully, Fanning brings nuance and intelligence to her role. --Jae-Ha Kim Beyond The Secret Life of Bees Australia The Ultimate Gift Amazing Grace Stills from The Secret Life of Bees (Click for larger image) \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I had seen this before and when granddaughter was reading as a Junior requirement, purchased as an addition after reading the book.

The action heats up Amazon.com The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the first Ice Age took a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano, Everyone Loves Raymond ), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo, Moulin Rouge! ), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary, Rescue Me ) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically, Three Mammals and a Baby )--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah, Bringing Down the House ) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo! rous fish.

Legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) returns to his sci-fi origins in this epic adventure bursting with spectacular action and mind-blowing visual effects. A team of scientists and explorers travels to the darkest corners of the universe searching for the origins of human life. Instead they find a dark, twisted world that hides a terrifying threat capable of destroying them...and all mankind! Amazon.com You want an alien world created anew, with wonders and horrors lurking in its furrows? You go to Ridley Scott, of course, spectacle maker and pictorialist par excellence. So Prometheus is bound to be eye filling, with fully wrought planetary vistas and occasionally jaw-dropping visual coups. And did we use the word alien back there? Yes, folks, Prometheus is a prequel, in a sideways sort of fashion, to Scott's 1979 Alien original--or at least it's a long-distant stage setter for that story. This one begins with a space mission that could reveal the extraterrestrial roots of Earth, although what's buried out on the planet turns out to be much more complicated than expected. In the midst of suspenseful episodes (and a few contrived plot turns), Prometheus reaches for Big Answers to Big Questions, in a grand old sci-fi tradition. This lends the movie a hint of metaphysical energy, even if Scott's reach extends well, well beyond his grasp. The hokier moments are carried off with brio by Michael Fassbender (the robot on board), Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba, and then you've got Noomi Rapace entering the badass hall of fame for a long, oh-no-they-didn't sequence involving radical surgery, which might just induce the vapors in a few viewers. Even if Prometheus has its holes, the sheer size of the thing is exciting to be around. Because this movie is gigantic. --Robert Horton . A team of scientists journey through the universe on the spaceship \"Prometheus\" on a voyage to investigate Alien life forms. The team of scientists becomes stranded on an Alien world, and as they struggle to survive it becomes clear that the horrors they experience are not just a threat to themselves, but to all of mankind. - WellardRockard Synopsis A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Meet the Characters Elizabeth Shaw View larger Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw captured the eyes of the international entertainment community with her commanding, unnerving and critically acclaimed portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the film adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo , The Girl Who Played With Fire , and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest . Rapace began her acting career at the age of seven, in Iceland's In the Shadow of the Raven . She has since gone to appear in over twenty films and television shows. Born in Sweden, Rapace is the daughter of Flamenco singer Rogelio Duran.  Shaw, an archaeologist, discovers a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading her and a team of scientists and explorers on a thrilling journey, aboard the spaceship Prometheus, to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Shaw and her team aboard the Prometheus are on nothing less than a journey to discover answers to some of life\u2019s most profound questions. She is a scientist filled with faith and hope, but who transforms into a warrior when faced with the danger she encounters at her destination. Michael Fassbender as David View larger Michael Fassbender as David enjoyed a phenomenal run of critically acclaimed performances in 2011 and 2012, garnering numerous accolades and awards. The National Board of Review awarded Fassbender the Spotlight Award, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association named him Best Actor for his performances in Shame and Davide Cronenberg\u2019s drama A Dangerous Method , in which Fassbender plays Carl Jung opposite Keira Knightley and Viggo Mortensen. Fassbender was also recently seen in Matthew Vaughn\u2019s X-Men: First Class , as Erik Lehnsherr, better known as super-villain Magneto; as Rochester in Cary Joji Fukunaga\u2019s Jane Eyre ; and as an assassin opposite Ewan McGregor and Gina Carano in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Haywire . Fassbender is a graduate of London's prestigious Drama Centre. His breakthrough role came as Sgt. Burton \"Pat\" Christenson in HBO's epic, award-winning miniseries Band of Brothers . David is an android creation of Weyland Industries. While David possesses extraordinary intelligence and other capabilities, his principal tasks aboard the Prometheus are servile. David is however far more \u201chuman\u201d than one might expect of a synthetic person. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing and therefore he is superior to the human crew members. David\u2019s allegiances are unclear, and he can be very bold in the decisions he makes.  Meredith Vickers View larger Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers demands the audience\u2019s full attention as soon as she appears on screen.

The action heats up Amazon.com The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the first Ice Age took a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano, Everyone Loves Raymond ), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo, Moulin Rouge! ), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary, Rescue Me ) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically, Three Mammals and a Baby )--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah, Bringing Down the House ) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo! rous fish. Add into the mix a herd of lava-worshipping mini-sloths, some Busby Berkeley-style vultures, and more ingenious slapstick featuring the acorn-crazed Scrat, and Ice Age: The Meltdown will amuse even jaded adults. -- Bret Fetzer Beyond Ice Age: The Meltdown Ice Age - Super Cool Edition Ice Age & Ice Age 2: The Meltdown - (DVD 2-Pack) Funtastic Adventures Collection Box Set (Ice Age / Robots / Fern Gully / Once Upon a Rainforest) Stills from Ice Age: The Meltdown (click for larger image)  rating: 4.0  review: My kids love this movie... all 3 movies... everytime I show them the box they run to the sofa to watch the movie.-------Item title: Underworld: Awakening [Blu-ray]  Item description: KATE BECKINSALE returns as the ultimate vampire warrioress Selene in Underworld Awakening, the stunning new installment of the epic saga.

Legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) returns to his sci-fi origins in this epic adventure bursting with spectacular action and mind-blowing visual effects. A team of scientists and explorers travels to the darkest corners of the universe searching for the origins of human life. Instead they find a dark, twisted world that hides a terrifying threat capable of destroying them...and all mankind! Amazon.com You want an alien world created anew, with wonders and horrors lurking in its furrows? You go to Ridley Scott, of course, spectacle maker and pictorialist par excellence. So Prometheus is bound to be eye filling, with fully wrought planetary vistas and occasionally jaw-dropping visual coups. And did we use the word alien back there? Yes, folks, Prometheus is a prequel, in a sideways sort of fashion, to Scott's 1979 Alien original--or at least it's a long-distant stage setter for that story. This one begins with a space mission that could reveal the extraterrestrial roots of Earth, although what's buried out on the planet turns out to be much more complicated than expected. In the midst of suspenseful episodes (and a few contrived plot turns), Prometheus reaches for Big Answers to Big Questions, in a grand old sci-fi tradition. This lends the movie a hint of metaphysical energy, even if Scott's reach extends well, well beyond his grasp. The hokier moments are carried off with brio by Michael Fassbender (the robot on board), Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba, and then you've got Noomi Rapace entering the badass hall of fame for a long, oh-no-they-didn't sequence involving radical surgery, which might just induce the vapors in a few viewers. Even if Prometheus has its holes, the sheer size of the thing is exciting to be around. Because this movie is gigantic. --Robert Horton . A team of scientists journey through the universe on the spaceship \"Prometheus\" on a voyage to investigate Alien life forms. The team of scientists becomes stranded on an Alien world, and as they struggle to survive it becomes clear that the horrors they experience are not just a threat to themselves, but to all of mankind. - WellardRockard Synopsis A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Meet the Characters Elizabeth Shaw View larger Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw captured the eyes of the international entertainment community with her commanding, unnerving and critically acclaimed portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the film adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo , The Girl Who Played With Fire , and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest . Rapace began her acting career at the age of seven, in Iceland's In the Shadow of the Raven . She has since gone to appear in over twenty films and television shows. Born in Sweden, Rapace is the daughter of Flamenco singer Rogelio Duran.  Shaw, an archaeologist, discovers a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading her and a team of scientists and explorers on a thrilling journey, aboard the spaceship Prometheus, to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Shaw and her team aboard the Prometheus are on nothing less than a journey to discover answers to some of life\u2019s most profound questions. She is a scientist filled with faith and hope, but who transforms into a warrior when faced with the danger she encounters at her destination. Michael Fassbender as David View larger Michael Fassbender as David enjoyed a phenomenal run of critically acclaimed performances in 2011 and 2012, garnering numerous accolades and awards. The National Board of Review awarded Fassbender the Spotlight Award, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association named him Best Actor for his performances in Shame and Davide Cronenberg\u2019s drama A Dangerous Method , in which Fassbender plays Carl Jung opposite Keira Knightley and Viggo Mortensen. Fassbender was also recently seen in Matthew Vaughn\u2019s X-Men: First Class , as Erik Lehnsherr, better known as super-villain Magneto; as Rochester in Cary Joji Fukunaga\u2019s Jane Eyre ; and as an assassin opposite Ewan McGregor and Gina Carano in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Haywire . Fassbender is a graduate of London's prestigious Drama Centre. His breakthrough role came as Sgt. Burton \"Pat\" Christenson in HBO's epic, award-winning miniseries Band of Brothers . David is an android creation of Weyland Industries. While David possesses extraordinary intelligence and other capabilities, his principal tasks aboard the Prometheus are servile. David is however far more \u201chuman\u201d than one might expect of a synthetic person. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing and therefore he is superior to the human crew members. David\u2019s allegiances are unclear, and he can be very bold in the decisions he makes.

With the help of complex computer animation and the research of hundreds of paleontologists, the BBC presents an extremely realistic picture of the earth's earliest, most primitive aquatic inhabitants and chronicles their evolution to the precursors of man himself and the mighty dinosaurs. The first Walking With Monsters episode begins in the Cambrian period 530 million years ago, showcasing how a simple jellyfish-like sea creature evolved over 200 million years into new creatures with eyes and protective external and internal skeletal systems. These adaptations resulted in the world's first fish, arthropods, amphibians, and land-loving reptiles. The second episode details the giant insects of the Carboniferous period 300 million years ago and demonstrates how evolution empowered amphibians and reptiles by creating mechanisms to regulate their own body temperature and developing specialized teeth. The final episode begins in the late Permian period 250 million years ago when the earth was essentially one large desert full of volcanic activity. While much of earth's life was extinguished during this period, adaptation and evolution continued, bringing the development of a specialized hip in a tiny reptile called the Euparkeria that would prove to be the forerunner of mammals and evolve into the dinosaurs in the Triassic period.

On the loose in Europe, three wild college grads from America bring their \"Daredevil Tour\" to Paris in search of some serious fun. There, Andy (Tom Everett Scott -- THAT THING YOU DO!) falls for the beautiful and mysterious woman of his dreams (Julie Delpy -- THE THREE MUSKETEERS). The only problem is ... when the moon is full, Andy's dream girl turns into a total nightmare! Rocking with a cool soundtrack featuring today's hottest cutting-edge recording artists, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS is an outrageously thrilling adventure you don't want to miss! Amazon.com On the strength of his Hitchcockian-thriller debut, Mute Witness , writer-director Anthony Waller was hired to direct this belated sequel to the 1981 horror comedy An American Werewolf in London , but lycanthropy in the City of Light just ain't what it used to be. The movie offers plenty of gruesome makeup and special wolf-transformation effects, and there are some effectively spooky moments in the plot involving an underground population of hungry Parisian werewolves. One of them is seductively played by Julie Delpy, who is rescued from attempted suicide by an American tourist (Tom Everett Scott, from That Thing You Do! ) but ultimately can't hide her dual identity when darkness falls and the full moon shines. The movie begins well, but gradually succumbs to nonsense and mayhem, prompting critic Roger Ebert to observe that \"here are people we don't care about, doing things they don't understand, in a movie without any rules.\" In other words, you'd have to be a die-hard horror buff to give this one the benefit of the doubt. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 1.0 \n review: Horrible.

Aimed at a teen audience but with crossover appeal to most viewers, the series dealt with recurring themes of loss and disappointment, made all the more interesting because Party of Five 's major characters, especially in season 1, are youthful siblings coping with the recent deaths of their parents in an automobile accident. Shocked into a beyond-their-years awareness of the fragility of ordinary life and the importance of loyalty and loving bonds, the Salinger offspring--24-year-old Charlie (Matthew Fox), high schoolers Bailey (Scott Wolf) and Julia (Neve Campbell), 11-year-old Claudia (Lacey Chabert), and baby Owen (various infant actors)--bring a deeply felt, sometimes desperate gravitas to lesser but still significant misfortunes in relationships, peer pressures, and ambitions. On top of that, each has to take on responsibilities beyond their experience--hiring nannies, raising money for mortgage payments, etc.--and make sacrifices robbing them of formative experiences. Charlie, accustomed to adult freedom, has to rejigger his plans and move back home as a surrogate, and often resented, parent. (If he doesn't do this, his brothers and sisters could be separated and sent to foster homes.) Ultra-responsible Bailey, with little time for homework, buddies, or girls, loses perspective and gets hung up on an older, appealing nanny (Paula Devicq). Top student Julia's academic career fades as she seeks a second family among undeserving thrill-seekers. Claudia, a gifted musician, pawns her violin. Despite all that drama, the essence of Party of Five is the Salingers' homing instinct, the way they survive internal and external conflict to find their way back to reassuring family rituals--among them weekly (free) dinners at the restaurant their late father owned. The 22 episodes on six discs in this boxed set typically test the Salingers' hopes, dreams, and mettle, and while stories can certainly be unsettling, a viewer is never left with serious worries that things won't turn out all right. Among the highlights are \"Homework,\" in which Julia, having made plans to attend a party rather than salvage her failing grade in English lit, stays home instead to save Bailey's bacon by writing his difficult term paper. The powerful \"Thanksgiving\" concerns a face-to-face meeting between the Salingers and the drunk driver (John Rubinstein) who killed their parents. Most memorable is a suite of episodes featuring Megan Ward as Bailey's girlfriend, Jill, a possible drug addict whose fate rocks the startling season finale, \"The Ides of March.\" --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I loved this show when it was on tv & was super excited to find it on Amazon.

Luckily her Fairy Godmother and mice friends, Jaq and Gus, are on hand to help out. 'Cinderella 3 - A Twist in Time' (2007) explores what may have happened had the mythical glass slipper not fit. Cinderella's wicked stepmother has stolen the Fairy Godmother's magic wand and now she's determined to turn back the hands of time to set Prince Charming up with one of her own daughters.

Crusading Detective/Psychologist ALEX CROSS (Tyler Perry) meets his match against the psychotic, mob hit man, MICHAEL SULLIVAN aka THE BUTCHER. As Cross investigates the hit man\u2019s gruesome murders, Sullivan decides to send him a deadly message by murdering his wife in cold blood. Now enraged, Cross vows to hunt down the killer if it\u2019s the last thing he does. However, Sullivan is a serial killing mastermind and continues to evade Cross while pushing him to an ethical breaking point as a cop and father. As Cross closes in on the killer, he discovers evidence that points to the unimaginable\u2013a revelation that could change everything. With unstoppable action, and unforeseeable twists, this suspenseful action thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat. Amazon.com Having cornered the market on his signature brand of inspirational comedy, Tyler Perry makes a bid for action-movie supremacy with this grisly adaptation of author James Patterson's most popular character. Loosely based on the 12th novel in the series (2007's Cross ), the plot follows the early days of the title character, a genius police detective/psychologist trying to clean up the mean streets of Detroit while keeping his family out of the line of fire. As he mulls over accepting a job with the FBI, he and his team are forced to match wits with a psychotic contract killer (Matthew Fox), who displays a disturbing commitment towards seeing his job through. Director Rob Cohen ( The Fast and the Furious , XXX ) knows this turf well, delivering an effective mix of creeping thriller sequences and go-for-broke action scenes. (Parents should be warned that the crime scenes glimpsed here push the PG-13 rating to the urpy limits and beyond.) Faced with the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of Morgan Freeman (who played the character in Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider ), Perry does a credible job in portraying both the tender and vengeful aspects of his character, even if the script often falls into the trap of having other characters exclaiming how brilliant Cross is, rather than letting the viewers see the deductive process for themselves. Based on his first attempt, any future entries in the franchise appear to be in good hands. Ultimately, however, the other elements of Alex Cross pale in comparison to Fox, who goes all out--and then some--in giving the audience someone to hiss at. He's shorn down to what appears to be a negative body-fat ratio, and occasionally literally froths at the mouth--and his dedication to creating a villain for the ages quickly overpowers the material.

At the center of the action are the Blue Mountain State Goats, the team with the nastiest sacks in all of college football. With a freshman lineup that includes a backup quarterback who\u2019d rather party than play, a star running back who can\u2019t score with the ladies, and a team mascot who redefines \u201dpersonal foul,\u201d will they be able to juggle football, girls, class and nonstop hazing? Blue Mountain State: Season One is the rudest, dirtiest comedy to ever hit the field. Amazon.com Blue Mountain State is a football comedy on the Spike channel, which means it's a carnival of booze, testosterone, girls, girls, girls--and a surprising amount of winking homoeroticism. Second-string quarterback Alex (Darin Brooks) couldn't care less about the games--he's there for the good times. Craig (Sam Jones III) wants success, and so does his controlling girlfriend Denise (Gabrielle Dennis). Sammy (Chris Romano, a.k.a. Romanski, who cocreated the series), the team mascot, just wants to get laid. And around these four characters is built a web of high jinks involving sex, drugs, strip clubs, venereal disease, masturbation, bodily fluids, and other subjects guys are supposed to find hilarious.

At the center of the action are the Blue Mountain State Goats, the team with the nastiest sacks in all of college football. With a freshman lineup that includes a backup quarterback who\u2019d rather party than play, a star running back who can\u2019t score with the ladies, and a team mascot who redefines \u201dpersonal foul,\u201d will they be able to juggle football, girls, class and nonstop hazing? Blue Mountain State: Season One is the rudest, dirtiest comedy to ever hit the field. Amazon.com Blue Mountain State is a football comedy on the Spike channel, which means it's a carnival of booze, testosterone, girls, girls, girls--and a surprising amount of winking homoeroticism. Second-string quarterback Alex (Darin Brooks) couldn't care less about the games--he's there for the good times. Craig (Sam Jones III) wants success, and so does his controlling girlfriend Denise (Gabrielle Dennis). Sammy (Chris Romano, a.k.a. Romanski, who cocreated the series), the team mascot, just wants to get laid. And around these four characters is built a web of high jinks involving sex, drugs, strip clubs, venereal disease, masturbation, bodily fluids, and other subjects guys are supposed to find hilarious. While the acting is enthusiastic and more or less competent, the situations and dialogue are inane at best (like a war between football and lacrosse players that can only be resolved by a promiscuous virgin, or when the team tries to break a losing streak by taking lots and lots of drugs) and insulting at worst (such as when the entire team gets syphilis from sharing the same sex toy, or when they try to blackmail a professor into giving them passing grades by having sex with his elderly mother).

Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. The unorthodox Schultz acquires Django with a promise to free him upon the capture of the Brittles \u2013 dead or alive. Success leads Schultz to free Django, though the two men choose not to go their separate ways. Instead, Schultz seeks out the South\u2019s most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago. Django and Schultz\u2019s search ultimately leads them to Calvin Candie (Academy Award\u00ae-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), the proprietor of \u201cCandyland,\u201d an infamous plantation. Exploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz rouse the suspicion of Stephen (Academy Award\u00ae-nominee Samuel L. Jackson), Candie\u2019s trusted house slave. Their moves are marked, and a treacherous organization closes in on them. If Django and Schultz are to escape with Broomhilda, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival\u2026 Amazon.com From the moment Jamie Foxx throws off a filthy, tattered blanket to reveal a richly muscled back crisscrossed with long scars, it's obvious that Django Unchained will be both true to its exploitation roots but also clear-eyed about the misery that's being exploited. Django (Foxx), a slave set free in the years before the Civil War, joins with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter (the marvelous Christoph Waltz, Inglourious Basterds ), who has promised to help Django rescue his wife (Kerry Washington), who's still enslaved to a gleeful and grandiose plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio, plainly relishing the opportunity to play an out-and-out villain). What follows is a wild and woolly ride, crammed with all the pleasures one expects from a revenge fantasy written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Plot-wise, some things happen a little too easily (for example, Django instantly becomes a master gunslinger), but the moral perspective is not glib. For all its lurid violence and jazzy dialogue, this is a still-rare movie that paints slavery for what it was: a brutal, dehumanizing practice that allowed a privileged few to profit from the suffering of many, a practice guaranteed by the gun and the whip. Think of it as the antidote to Gone with the Wind . Tarantino is more heartfelt in Django Unchained than in any of his previous movies--without sacrificing any of the pell-mell action, tension, and delicious language that made Reservoir Dogs , Kill Bill , and Pulp Fiction so very enjoyable. --Bret Fetzer \n rating: 3.0 \n review: It started off entertaining then fell off the cliff. I thought the film worked up until the character played by Christopher Waltz (who was great in this) was killed then the story meanders and falls apart. Other things that bothered me. The sequence where they played the Jim Croce song \"I got a name\"......why in the hell did Tarantino pick this song? I understand the Morricone cues scattered throughout the film as well as the opening theme which was ripped from the 1966 movie Django, and somewhat the rap songs since it is a blaxplotation film to some degree. But the Jim Croce selection from 1973 brings up images (for me anyway) of gas stations,18-wheelers,and bell bottoms. Also the huge shootout I had issues with. How many white henchmen were on this plantation? 25? 50? I was thinking to myself \"where were these people when they came up on the plantation?\" And then Django is magically protected from dozens of bullets by a cabinet??? The character played by Samuel L Jackson, a slave, yells at the white people to \"Stop shooting!\"........and they actually listen to him????? Django would have been killed on site,not saved by a slave then sent off to a mine to break down rocks.Perhaps I am being too critical and should have just allowed myself to enjoy the film for what it is. And about my previous issue with all the white southerners that were shot. I guess in most Tarantino films you have unrealistic mass killings. In Inglorious Basterds you have the Nazi who is in the tower and shoots a hundred or so soldiers. In Kill Bill you have Uma who slices and dices about 20 or so Ninjas in a scene. I will close with this. Django Unchained in this day of mindless 3-D action movies, remakes, and dime a dozen romantic comedies is a breath of fresh air. And the first half of the movie is great. But..... the final 30 minutes or so for this movie just killed it for me.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I love movies with intriguing plots, strong character development, and a mix of action and drama.

The destinies of the characters range from joining the German army to making for England, the OSS, and the Resistance. Across a canvas lasting almost three hours, director Paul Verhoeven unfolds a saga of friendship, espionage, and romance with almost documentary realism--though not as graphically violent as his later American films, the torture scenes are intense--crafting a deeply affecting film widely regarded as the greatest ever made in Holland. Comparable recent films such as Enigma (2001) and Charlotte Gray (2002) do not come close. Hauer is brilliant at the heart of what is a detailed and thoughtful drama made with integrity and passion. Twenty years later in 1997, Verhoeven made Starship Troopers , a satirical science-fiction companion to this modern European classic. --Gary S. Dalkin \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I'm a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's American movies.  Once I moved to Holland, I thought I'd check out his older Dutch movies.  I found an English-subtitled version through Amazon.com and I wasn't dissappointed.  It is one hell of a war movie.  One of the best I've seen.  It was pretty cool to see Rutger Hauer acting in his native Dutch language before he went off to Hollywood as well.  Another recognizeable actor, Jeroen Krabbe, is in this too.<br />I didn't even mind reading subtitles through almost the whole movie(some parts of it are in English).<br />If you like war movies, check this out.

Genre: Feature Film-Action/Adventure Rating: PG Release Date: 8-FEB-2005 Media Type: DVD Additional Features Filled out with about eight minutes of additional footage, this deluxe Superman almost doubles Marlon Brando's screen time with added scenes on Krypton and in the Fortress of Solitude and fills out the early life of Clark Kent, contributing to a more mythic portrait of America's greatest hero. There is also more disaster footage during the earthquake climax, and Lex Luthor's \"Gauntlet of Death\" sequence (seen on network TV broadcasts) is reinstated. The commentary by director Richard Donner and \"creative consultant\" Tom Mankeiwicz lacks the focus and detail of a filmmaker really grappling with his work (it has been almost 25 years, after all), but it's full of interesting asides, casting trivia (Goldie Hawn as Miss Teschmacher?), and the good-humored byplay of two old friends. The three documentary featurettes hosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) are essentially chapters of a comprehensive behind-the-scenes study, full of illuminating interviews (Donner and Mankeiwicz are more revealing here), special-effects tests (including all the failed attempts to make you believe a man can fly), and the bizarre true story of the unceremonious firing of Richard Donner after he had turned Superman into a worldwide smash and shot about 70 percent of the sequel. A separate supplement features screen tests for Christopher Reeve and five different Lois Lanes (including a giggly Leslie Ann Warren and a snappy Stockard Channing), and two legendary, delightfully demented scenes featuring Lex Luthor's snarling \"babies\" (also seen on TV broadcasts) are featured in the gallery of Deleted Scenes. --Sean Axmaker \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I couldn't get enough of this movie as a kid.  I'd watch it over and over everyday.<br />I'm now 26 and am thrilled to own this on DVD.  It is still my favorite movie ever.<br />The movie looks incredible and the sound is phenomenal.  John Williams' score still gives me goosebumps.<br />Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman and Gene Hackman is equally awesome as Lex Luthor.  The opening scenes with Marlon Brando are great too.  There are simply too many thing to mention about this movie.<br />The added scenes along with all the great extras definitely put this in the 'must have' category.<br />You can't go wrong with this one.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey there, I've been really enjoying a mix of action-packed and classic movies lately, and I'm always looking for more surprises and legendary matchups - got anything in mind for me?\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Genre: Feature Film-Action/Adventure Rating: PG Release Date: 8-FEB-2005 Media Type: DVD Additional Features Filled out with about eight minutes of additional footage, this deluxe Superman almost doubles Marlon Brando's screen time with added scenes on Krypton and in the Fortress of Solitude and fills out the early life of Clark Kent, contributing to a more mythic portrait of America's greatest hero. There is also more disaster footage during the earthquake climax, and Lex Luthor's \"Gauntlet of Death\" sequence (seen on network TV broadcasts) is reinstated. The commentary by director Richard Donner and \"creative consultant\" Tom Mankeiwicz lacks the focus and detail of a filmmaker really grappling with his work (it has been almost 25 years, after all), but it's full of interesting asides, casting trivia (Goldie Hawn as Miss Teschmacher?), and the good-humored byplay of two old friends. The three documentary featurettes hosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) are essentially chapters of a comprehensive behind-the-scenes study, full of illuminating interviews (Donner and Mankeiwicz are more revealing here), special-effects tests (including all the failed attempts to make you believe a man can fly), and the bizarre true story of the unceremonious firing of Richard Donner after he had turned Superman into a worldwide smash and shot about 70 percent of the sequel. A separate supplement features screen tests for Christopher Reeve and five different Lois Lanes (including a giggly Leslie Ann Warren and a snappy Stockard Channing), and two legendary, delightfully demented scenes featuring Lex Luthor's snarling \"babies\" (also seen on TV broadcasts) are featured in the gallery of Deleted Scenes. --Sean Axmaker  rating: 5.0  review: I couldn't get enough of this movie as a kid.  I'd watch it over and over everyday.<br />I'm now 26 and am thrilled to own this on DVD.  It is still my favorite movie ever.<br />The movie looks incredible and the sound is phenomenal.  John Williams' score still gives me goosebumps.<br />Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman and Gene Hackman is equally awesome as Lex Luthor.  The opening scenes with Marlon Brando are great too.  There are simply too many thing to mention about this movie.<br />The added scenes along with all the great extras definitely put this in the 'must have' category.<br />You can't go wrong with this one.-------```And here is the user's intention: Hey there, I've been really enjoying a mix of action-packed and classic movies lately, and I'm always looking for more surprises and legendary matchups - got anything in mind for me?Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Now Bambi, Walt Disney's beloved coming-of-age story, will thrill a new generation of fans with its breathtakingly beautiful animation, soaring music and characters who will touch your heart-Bambi, the wide-eyed fawn, his playful pal Thumper, the loveable skunk Flower and wise Friend Owl. Plus, all-new immersive game and special features that reveal the extraordinary creative process behind the making of this timeless classic take you deeper into Bambi's world than ever before. Walt Disney's Bambi is an experience you will never forget-now more brilliant than ever on Blu-ray. Additional Features Unlike many of Disney's Blu-ray releases, the color hasn't been oversaturated on Bambi , a wise decision as the delicate palette contributes so much to the poetic visuals discussed in the extras. The most important--and striking--of the new features is \"Inside Walt's Story Meetings.\" Actors impersonating Walt Disney and several of his key artists read partial transcripts of discussions that took place during the creation of the film, between 1937 and 1940. Their narration is juxtaposed with the finished film and insets of relevant sketches, stills, rough animation, etc. Sadly, the filmmakers mar this striking explication with annoying pop-up windows inviting the viewer to see this or listen to that. Also included are storyboards and sketches for two deleted sequences. In \"Two Leaves\" (introduced by this reviewer), the last two leaves clinging to an autumn tree speculate about their ultimate fate. Although the leaves provide a poignant moment in the book, they only distract the audience from the main story arc. Similarly, a scene of Bambi getting tangled up in a reed and disturbing a wood mouse's nest is amusing, but does nothing to further the plot. And listeners will agree Walt was wise to cut a very forgettable song about being twitterpated. It all adds up to a beautiful package that can only deepen the viewer's appreciation of the most lyrical of Walt Disney's animated features. --Charles Solomon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I am upgrading all my old Disney films to the Diamond Edition BluRays and im very happy with this purchase.

In Part 1, Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort\u2019s immortality and destruction \u2013 the Horcruxes. On their own and on the run, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever\u2026but Dark Forces in their midst threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile the wizarding world has become a dangerous place. The long-feared war has begun and the Dark Lord has seized control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting all who might oppose him. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort\u2026alive.  Part 2 in the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here. ]]> \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This edition is the Ultimate Edition- Or at least that's what its called- I don't know if i would call it ultimate because it isn't an extended edition etc but it was definitely great. Nice packaging & inclusions, great movies and lots of special features but i'm disappointed that it didn't include an extended version of the movies- the thing that makes up for this is that the 2 parts of book 7 are at least together and the price was really great considering how much content there is.-------\nItem title: Avatar (Extended Collector's Edition) \n Item description: Product Description Experience the spectacular world of James Cameron's Avatar as never before with this all-new three-disc extended collector\u2019s edition. The journey begins with three movie versions: the original theatrical release, the special edition re-release, and the exclusive extended cut not shown in theaters. And that's just what's on the first Blu-ray disc. The set's bonus feature run more than eight hours and include over 45 minutes of deleted scenes; actor's screen tests; on-location footage; feature-length documentaries on the film's groundbreaking production; an interactive scene-deconstruction feature that lets you explore different levels of production for 17 scenes; a comprehensive guide to the world of Pandora; and more. The greatest adventure of all time just got bigger and better. Amazon.com Here's what we had to say about the original theatrical edition of Avatar after seeing it on the big screen:After 12 years of thinking about it (and waiting for movie technology to catch up with his visions), James Cameron followed up his unsinkable Titanic with Avatar , a sci-fi epic meant to trump all previous sci-fi epics. Set in the future on a distant planet, Avatar spins a simple little parable about greedy colonizers (that would be mankind) messing up the lush tribal world of Pandora. A paraplegic Marine named Jake (Sam Worthington) acts through a 9-foot-tall avatar that allows him to roam the planet and pass as one of the Na'vi, the blue-skinned, large-eyed native people who would very much like to live their peaceful lives without the interference of the visitors. Although he's supposed to be gathering intel for the badass general (Stephen Lang) who'd like to lay waste to the planet and its inhabitants, Jake naturally begins to take a liking to the Na'vi, especially the feisty Neytiri (Zo\u00eb Saldana, whose entire performance, recorded by Cameron's complicated motion-capture system, exists as a digitally rendered Na'vi). The movie uses state-of-the-art 3D technology to plunge the viewer deep into Cameron's crazy toy box of planetary ecosystems and high-tech machinery. Maybe it's the fact that Cameron seems torn between his two loves--awesome destructive gizmos and flower-power message mongering--that makes Avatar 's pursuit of its point ultimately uncertain. That, and the fact that Cameron's dialogue continues to clunk badly. If you're won over by the movie's trippy new world, the characters will be forgivable as broad, useful archetypes rather than standard-issue stereotypes, and you might be able to overlook the unsurprising central plot. (The overextended \"take that, Michael Bay\" final battle sequences could tax even Cameron enthusiasts, however.) It doesn't measure up to the hype (what could?) yet Avatar frequently hits a giddy delirium all its own. The film itself is our Pandora, a sensation-saturated universe only the movies could create. --Robert Horton Versions of Avatar on Blu-ray and DVD Edition Format Release Date Special Features Avatar (Extended Collector's Edition) Three Blu-ray Discs Nov. 16, 2010 Three versions of the movie including the previously unreleased extended cut, plus more than eight hours of bonus features including over 45 minutes of deleted scenes, interactive scene deconstruction, Pandorapedia , documentaries and featurettes, and BD-LIVE content (requires compatible player and Internet connection) Avatar (Extended Collector's Edition) Three DVDs Nov. 16, 2010 Three versions of the movie including the previously unreleased extended cut, plus more than three hours of bonus features including documentaries and over 45 minutes of deleted scenes Avatar (Original Theatrical Edition) Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo Apr. 22, 2010 None Avatar (Original Theatrical Edition) DVD Apr. 22, 2010 None Contents of the Blu-ray Extended Collector's Edition What follows is the back-of-the box summary of the Blu-ray set's contents and then a complete listing of everything that's included.

Now Bambi, Walt Disney's beloved coming-of-age story, will thrill a new generation of fans with its breathtakingly beautiful animation, soaring music and characters who will touch your heart-Bambi, the wide-eyed fawn, his playful pal Thumper, the loveable skunk Flower and wise Friend Owl. Plus, all-new immersive game and special features that reveal the extraordinary creative process behind the making of this timeless classic take you deeper into Bambi's world than ever before. Walt Disney's Bambi is an experience you will never forget-now more brilliant than ever on Blu-ray. Additional Features Unlike many of Disney's Blu-ray releases, the color hasn't been oversaturated on Bambi , a wise decision as the delicate palette contributes so much to the poetic visuals discussed in the extras. The most important--and striking--of the new features is \"Inside Walt's Story Meetings.\" Actors impersonating Walt Disney and several of his key artists read partial transcripts of discussions that took place during the creation of the film, between 1937 and 1940. Their narration is juxtaposed with the finished film and insets of relevant sketches, stills, rough animation, etc. Sadly, the filmmakers mar this striking explication with annoying pop-up windows inviting the viewer to see this or listen to that. Also included are storyboards and sketches for two deleted sequences. In \"Two Leaves\" (introduced by this reviewer), the last two leaves clinging to an autumn tree speculate about their ultimate fate. Although the leaves provide a poignant moment in the book, they only distract the audience from the main story arc. Similarly, a scene of Bambi getting tangled up in a reed and disturbing a wood mouse's nest is amusing, but does nothing to further the plot. And listeners will agree Walt was wise to cut a very forgettable song about being twitterpated. It all adds up to a beautiful package that can only deepen the viewer's appreciation of the most lyrical of Walt Disney's animated features. --Charles Solomon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I am upgrading all my old Disney films to the Diamond Edition BluRays and im very happy with this purchase. Its the classic story with the color and clarity of Blu Ray so what more could i ask for-------\nItem title: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts 1 and 2 (2-Movie Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts 1 and 2 Ultimate Edition (Blu-ray / DVD) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final adventure in the Harry Potter film series, is a motion picture event, told in two full-length parts. In Part 1, Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort\u2019s immortality and destruction \u2013 the Horcruxes. On their own and on the run, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever\u2026but Dark Forces in their midst threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile the wizarding world has become a dangerous place. The long-feared war has begun and the Dark Lord has seized control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting all who might oppose him. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort\u2026alive.  Part 2 in the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here. ]]> \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This edition is the Ultimate Edition- Or at least that's what its called- I don't know if i would call it ultimate because it isn't an extended edition etc but it was definitely great. Nice packaging & inclusions, great movies and lots of special features but i'm disappointed that it didn't include an extended version of the movies- the thing that makes up for this is that the 2 parts of book 7 are at least together and the price was really great considering how much content there is.-------\nItem title: Avatar (Extended Collector's Edition) \n Item description: Product Description Experience the spectacular world of James Cameron's Avatar as never before with this all-new three-disc extended collector\u2019s edition. The journey begins with three movie versions: the original theatrical release, the special edition re-release, and the exclusive extended cut not shown in theaters. And that's just what's on the first Blu-ray disc. The set's bonus feature run more than eight hours and include over 45 minutes of deleted scenes; actor's screen tests; on-location footage; feature-length documentaries on the film's groundbreaking production; an interactive scene-deconstruction feature that lets you explore different levels of production for 17 scenes; a comprehensive guide to the world of Pandora; and more. The greatest adventure of all time just got bigger and better. Amazon.com Here's what we had to say about the original theatrical edition of Avatar after seeing it on the big screen:After 12 years of thinking about it (and waiting for movie technology to catch up with his visions), James Cameron followed up his unsinkable Titanic with Avatar , a sci-fi epic meant to trump all previous sci-fi epics. Set in the future on a distant planet, Avatar spins a simple little parable about greedy colonizers (that would be mankind) messing up the lush tribal world of Pandora. A paraplegic Marine named Jake (Sam Worthington) acts through a 9-foot-tall avatar that allows him to roam the planet and pass as one of the Na'vi, the blue-skinned, large-eyed native people who would very much like to live their peaceful lives without the interference of the visitors. Although he's supposed to be gathering intel for the badass general (Stephen Lang) who'd like to lay waste to the planet and its inhabitants, Jake naturally begins to take a liking to the Na'vi, especially the feisty Neytiri (Zo\u00eb Saldana, whose entire performance, recorded by Cameron's complicated motion-capture system, exists as a digitally rendered Na'vi). The movie uses state-of-the-art 3D technology to plunge the viewer deep into Cameron's crazy toy box of planetary ecosystems and high-tech machinery. Maybe it's the fact that Cameron seems torn between his two loves--awesome destructive gizmos and flower-power message mongering--that makes Avatar 's pursuit of its point ultimately uncertain. That, and the fact that Cameron's dialogue continues to clunk badly. If you're won over by the movie's trippy new world, the characters will be forgivable as broad, useful archetypes rather than standard-issue stereotypes, and you might be able to overlook the unsurprising central plot. (The overextended \"take that, Michael Bay\" final battle sequences could tax even Cameron enthusiasts, however.) It doesn't measure up to the hype (what could?) yet Avatar frequently hits a giddy delirium all its own. The film itself is our Pandora, a sensation-saturated universe only the movies could create. --Robert Horton Versions of Avatar on Blu-ray and DVD Edition Format Release Date Special Features Avatar (Extended Collector's Edition) Three Blu-ray Discs Nov. 16, 2010 Three versions of the movie including the previously unreleased extended cut, plus more than eight hours of bonus features including over 45 minutes of deleted scenes, interactive scene deconstruction, Pandorapedia , documentaries and featurettes, and BD-LIVE content (requires compatible player and Internet connection) Avatar (Extended Collector's Edition) Three DVDs Nov. 16, 2010 Three versions of the movie including the previously unreleased extended cut, plus more than three hours of bonus features including documentaries and over 45 minutes of deleted scenes Avatar (Original Theatrical Edition) Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo Apr. 22, 2010 None Avatar (Original Theatrical Edition) DVD Apr. 22, 2010 None Contents of the Blu-ray Extended Collector's Edition What follows is the back-of-the box summary of the Blu-ray set's contents and then a complete listing of everything that's included.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Purple Rain (DVD) \n Description: Product Description Purple Rain (DVD) Rock star Prince makes a spectacular feature film debut in this highly autobiographical blockbuster that won both an Oscar and a Grammy award. Headstrong, vulnerable young musician The Kid (Prince) struggles with his own inner demons and with his alcoholic father who beats his mother. But the madness infects his music, fueling a sound that transforms the struggling, young rocker into a star. ]]> Amazon.com When Prince's dazzling and dynamic Purple Rain (movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single \"When Doves Cry\" exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents. The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including \"Let's Go Crazy\" and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers. Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition. Purple Rain is an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist. Prince took home an Oscar for the song score. --Jim Emerson",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Mozart - Die Zauberflote [Blu-ray] \n Description: Product Description The internationally renowned Mozart interpreter Sir Colin Davis conducts the chorus and orchestra of the Royal Opera House and a glittering cast in David McVicar's 2003 production of Mozart's last opera recorded, in sumptuous surround sound, live at Covent Garden. Recorded in High Definition. Press Reviews \"This production's slow journey from darkness into the light\u2026works well on the small screen, not least thanks to high-definition camera work and Sue Judd's inspired direction for television. The real magic, though, is supplied by the onstage cast...In Dorothea R\u00f6schmann's hands, Pamina emerges not so much a powerless victim of Fate but more as a passionate woman prepared to suffer in the nameof love. Her natural command of the stage is sagely employed by McVicar...Diana Damrau's supremely sung Queen of the Night oozes class, while Simon Keenlyside's profoundly human, touchingly sympathetic view of Papageno deserves an Olivier Award.\" (Classic fM ) \"...a mellow warmth that was deeply satisfying. Simon Keenlyside...a triumph as quite the most engaging Papageno I have ever encountered...With an exceptional Queen of the Night, Diana Damrou, this is an evening no Mozart lover should miss...\" (The Mail on Sunday ) Cast Simon Keenlyside (Papageno) Dorothea R\u00f6schmann (Pamina) Will Hartmann (Tamino) Diana Damrau (Queen of the Night) Franz-Josef Selig (Sarasto) The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Sir Colin Davis Production Company: The Royal Opera Stage Director: David McVicar Disc Information Catalogue Number: OABD7002D Date of Performance: 2003 Running Time: 185 minutes Sound: 2.0 PCM & 5.1 DTS Aspect Ratio: 1080i High Definition / 16:9 Subtitles: EN, FR, DE (EXTRAS ONLY) ES (PAL) EN, ES (NTSC) Label: Opus Arte Amazon.com It\u2019s hard to find a version of Mozart\u2019s Die Zauberfl\u00f6te that\u2019s as well sung as this 2003 Covent Garden production. Led by the eminent Mozartian, Sir Colin Davis, orchestra and singers present a warm, often intense vision of the opera, not as the fairy tale it\u2019s often taken for, but as a human drama of the passage from misguided beliefs to mature knowledge of self. Diana Damrau is the Queen of the Night for our time, with show-stopping bravura singing that tosses off the score\u2019s terrifying high notes with almost casual abandon. Her acting and her fright outfit never leave you in doubt that she\u2019s the evil presence here, even when she\u2019s pretending to be a good mom concerned about her daughter, Pamina. Dorothea R\u00f6schmann is superb, floating pianissimo notes to die for and singing with a beautifully rounded soprano allied to a dramatic sense that make her Ach, ich fuhl's so moving. Will Hartman is a virile Tamino, a bit heavier of voice than most of the lyric tenors who take the role, but singing well. Like most Tamino\u2019s, he\u2019s upstaged by Papageno, the bird-catcher who\u2019s his sidekick. Baritone Simon Keenlyside offers the best-sung Papageno one could hope to hear, and while he\u2019s funny in many of his more physical scenes, he replaces the usual clownish buffoon with an earth-bound Everyman. The noble Sarastro, the lovers\u2019 guide to self-realization, is well sung by Franz-Josef Selig, whose ample bass easily encompasses the low Fs that make most basses sound strained. The smaller roles are done well, too. Ailish Tynan has a romp as Papagena; the evil Monostatos is done to vocal and acting perfection by Adrian Thompson, the Queen\u2019s Three Ladies are well-matched and appropriately edgy, and the Temple Priests are convincingly sung and acted. This production of Die Zauberfl\u00f6te is a dark one. Producer David McVicar and conductor Davis reject the relatively recent transformation of the opera into a Disney-like romp for kids. The comic element in the opera is there, but its philosophical underpinnings--humanity\u2019s fitful progress to a higher plane \u2013 are paramount. There are still plenty of laughs with the fake dragon that pursues Tamino at the opera\u2019s opening and Papageno\u2019s funny business with a bird, among other chuckle-inducing scenes. But the production\u2019s Stygian backgrounds make for an oppressive setting. When light enters, as in the pomp of Sarastro\u2019s entry or the blazing yellow disc of the sun that conquers darkness, the opera\u2019s meanings are crystal-clear. Most of the characters wear 18th Century outfits, to comic effect as Monostatos\u2019 heavy makeup, lipsticked mouth, and elaborate wig. But there are occasional incongruities: Tamino\u2019s smock, the Three Boys\u2019 knit sweaters and short pants, and Papagana\u2019s mangy fur coat, among others. They\u2019re well intregrated into the staging so they don\u2019t jar. Nor, aside from the occasional too-tight closeups, does the video direction. In the special features, Davis speaks of the opera\u2019s tension between \"lighthearted music and the seriousness of the story,\" and all elements of this production fuse those key aspects in a way that makes this Blu-ray disc a joy to hear and watch. --Dan Davis Review This specific take on the classical opera produced by David McVicar truly brings new life to a musical work with a formidable history. Massive and incredibly rich decors set the mood in a perfect fashion allowing the audience to fully immerse into the magic world of Tamino and Pamina. From the giant snake in the opening act to the fearful Queen of the Night every single character and creature in Die Zauberflote is treated with an utmost amount of care. The cast is equally impressive. The flawless recreation of a long, complex, and very demanding story where multiple characters are responsible for a colorful mosaic of words and tunes is something one has to see in order to appreciate - unlike cinema where cast and director have the luxury of experimenting with different ideas over and over again opera demands utmost precision and professionalism, here everything happens in real time, and there is no room for mediocrity. Finally, this specific presentation was recorded at the Covent Garden in 2003 and it would be unfair not to praise the outstanding contribution by the Royal Opera House Orchestra and Choir under the baton of Sir Colin Davis. Mozart's music is truly alive here, performed with a degree of perfectionism one would be hard pressed not to admire. -- Blu-Ray.com, Svet Atanasov, June 2008 See more",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Nicky's Family \n Description: Product Description Ordinary British stockbroker Nicholas Winton organized the rescue of 669 children from Prague just before the outbreak of World War II. As a result of his heroic efforts, today there are over 6,000 descendants of 'Winton's Children\" all over the world. Winton, now 104 years old, did not speak about these events with anyone for more than half a century. His exploits would have probably been forgotten if his wife, fifty years later, hadn't found a suitcase in the attic, full of documents and transport plans. The children that he saved, their descendants and countless others around the world continue to follow his example to do good, as chronicled in the award-winning film Nicky's Family. Review Pick of the Day! Gr 7 Up When a hidden scrapbook of children s photos, descriptions, and letters surfaced, a riveting account of rescue and courage emerged: the record of Sir Nicholas Winton s efforts in Czechoslovakia during WWII. An Englishman of wealth and privilege, he responded in 1938 to a friend s warning that children were in danger under the Nazis. Nicky uncharacteristically threw himself into the task of securing exit visas and adoptive homes for more than 600 Jewish Czech children. Deportations and murder threatened, so parents sought refuge for their children. He devised a meticulous system, allowing British families to select adoptees by photo and description. Counterfeit travel documents were printed, kindertransports arranged. Dozens of adult survivors describe their origins, suffering, and eventual salvation, illustrated by Nazi-era photos and film footage, matched with dramatic recreations. An emotional conclusion celebrates that more than 5,700 people today credit Sir Nicholas, now a vigorous 100 year old, with saving their families. This Holocaust history stands out above others for its breadth and precision. A top choice for Holocaust studies and profoundly memorable.

The dazzling, long-beloved series was a daring experiment in \"omnibus\" TV, trading the speculative fantasies of The Twilight Zone for farther-out sci-fi concepts. Producers Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stefano had risen as gifted writers from (respectively) Broadway and Hollywood; Stevens rebounded from his previous canceled series, while Stefano had scripted Hitchcock's Psycho and was eager to expand his creative horizons.

Amazon.com Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen and Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan View larger Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan and Mackenzie Foy as Renesmee View larger Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen View larger Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black and Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan View larger Twihards, rejoice! In The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2 , love for Bella and Edward is not only triumphant--it's a love story for the ages. The finale in the wildly successful Twilight teen vampire romance saga will satisfy every passionate fan, and yet is broad enough in its appeal that even those who think they aren't invested in the Bella-Edward story will be drawn in as well. Breaking Dawn, Part 2 is breathtakingly beautiful, with sumptuous cinematography showing off the stark beauty of the Pacific Northwest, especially in the dead of winter. And speaking of stark beauty, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is even more ravishing than ever. She awakens at the beginning of Breaking Dawn, Part 2 as a \"newborn\" vampire, having been \"turned\" as she was dying during the birth of her and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) half-vampire daughter. Vampire Bella flies through the forests barefoot in a royal-blue sheath, no hint of post-baby body weighing her or her new superpowers down. Bella and Edward waste no time making good use of the cozy new cottage in the woods and its enticing bedroom. \"Why do we need a bedroom?\" Bella asks Edward. \"We're vampires, we don't sleep.\" Edward, adoration in his eyes, quickly shows her the answer. And their daughter? Well, little baby Renesmee starts out as a slightly creepy computer-generated animation creature, but as she grows--very quickly--into girlhood, she's played with winsome solemnity by young Mackenzie Foy. The girl is \"imprinted\" at birth to werewolf Jacob (hunky Taylor Lautner, often shirtless), who will from then on be bound to the wolf pack in a deep and special way. Yet Breaking Dawn, Part 2 carries true, operatic-style action as well as the love-triangle drama from earlier films. Because of the birth of the child vampire, the powerful Volturi in Rome are alerted, and, led by Aro (played by Michael Sheen, who appears to be having entirely too much fun), come to the Northwest for a shattering showdown over the fate of the Cullens. The confrontation, as directed by the deft Bill Condon, is intense and creatively choreographed (and fairly violent, given the film's PG-13 rating), with dark, wild music accompanying the Volturi's malevolent intentions and our heroes' fierce devotion to one another. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2 demonstrates that love and family can surmount nearly every obstacle. And sometimes love can truly be forever. --A.T. Hurley \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Breaking Dawn is my favorite book of the entire series, and this movie does not disappoint.  It brings to life every amazing detail of the finale to the story.

Amazon.com Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen and Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan View larger Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan and Mackenzie Foy as Renesmee View larger Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen View larger Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black and Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan View larger Twihards, rejoice! In The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2 , love for Bella and Edward is not only triumphant--it's a love story for the ages. The finale in the wildly successful Twilight teen vampire romance saga will satisfy every passionate fan, and yet is broad enough in its appeal that even those who think they aren't invested in the Bella-Edward story will be drawn in as well. Breaking Dawn, Part 2 is breathtakingly beautiful, with sumptuous cinematography showing off the stark beauty of the Pacific Northwest, especially in the dead of winter. And speaking of stark beauty, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is even more ravishing than ever. She awakens at the beginning of Breaking Dawn, Part 2 as a \"newborn\" vampire, having been \"turned\" as she was dying during the birth of her and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) half-vampire daughter. Vampire Bella flies through the forests barefoot in a royal-blue sheath, no hint of post-baby body weighing her or her new superpowers down. Bella and Edward waste no time making good use of the cozy new cottage in the woods and its enticing bedroom. \"Why do we need a bedroom?\" Bella asks Edward. \"We're vampires, we don't sleep.\" Edward, adoration in his eyes, quickly shows her the answer. And their daughter? Well, little baby Renesmee starts out as a slightly creepy computer-generated animation creature, but as she grows--very quickly--into girlhood, she's played with winsome solemnity by young Mackenzie Foy. The girl is \"imprinted\" at birth to werewolf Jacob (hunky Taylor Lautner, often shirtless), who will from then on be bound to the wolf pack in a deep and special way. Yet Breaking Dawn, Part 2 carries true, operatic-style action as well as the love-triangle drama from earlier films. Because of the birth of the child vampire, the powerful Volturi in Rome are alerted, and, led by Aro (played by Michael Sheen, who appears to be having entirely too much fun), come to the Northwest for a shattering showdown over the fate of the Cullens. The confrontation, as directed by the deft Bill Condon, is intense and creatively choreographed (and fairly violent, given the film's PG-13 rating), with dark, wild music accompanying the Volturi's malevolent intentions and our heroes' fierce devotion to one another. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2 demonstrates that love and family can surmount nearly every obstacle. And sometimes love can truly be forever. --A.T. Hurley \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Breaking Dawn is my favorite book of the entire series, and this movie does not disappoint.  It brings to life every amazing detail of the finale to the story. I laugh at people who question the ability of a vampire to create a baby.  This is a story about vampires and werewolves.  Anything is possible when you open up your mind to fiction. I'm sad to see it all end, and I do hope that Stephenie Meyer finds inspiration to write more adventures for the Cullen clan in the future. A television series would be great as well.

Amazon.com Part- Lost , part- The Day After , television's first Code Orange serial drama very effectively taps into palpable post-9/11 dread. The residents of Jericho are literally in the dark when they are cut off from civilization in the wake of a nuclear blast. Has the United States been attacked? How many cities were destroyed? Was it terrorists, or something way more sinister? It is up to Johnston Green (an Emmy-worthy Gerald McRaney), the town's mayor (and series bedrock), to calm the community, keep its citizens from turning on each other, and protect them from predatory outsiders. Johnston's son, Jake (Skeet Ulrich), a \"screw-up,\" returns home just prior to the blast following a mysterious five-year absence. Jake is at odds with his estranged father, who is running for reelection, and his brother, Eric (Kenneth Mitchell), his deputy. Nor is he welcomed back by his former girlfriend, Emily (Ashley Scott), now engaged to a man who is missing following the blast. With the fate of America in the balance, one would think that \"small town problems\" wouldn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy new world, but it is Jericho 's human dramas that resonate most deeply. On the most cherished TV shows, characters come to feel like family. Jericho 's characters come to feel like neighbors. Dale (Erik Knudson), the orphaned teenage outcast, forms an unexpected friendship with the town's spoiled mean girl, Skylar (Candace Bailey). Robert Hawkins (Lennie James), just arrived in town, introduces himself as a former cop from St. Louis, but his secret basement command center suggests otherwise. Gray Anderson (Michael Gaston), a mayoral candidate, politicizes the disaster to undermine Johnston. Stanley (Brad Beyer), a farmer, falls in love with his condescending IRS auditor from Washington, D.C. (Alicia Coppola). And Eric plans to leave his wife, Alice (Darby Stanchfield) for bartender Mary (Clare Carey). But at the heart of Jericho 's first season is Jake's hard-earned redemption in his family's (and Emily's) eyes (suddenly, he's a regular MacGyver, able to perform a tracheotomy with a juice box straw!). Star Trek has its Trekkies/-ers and Laurel and Hardy its fraternal organization, the Sons of the Desert . Jericho has its \"Nuts,\" who, in heroic It Takes a Village spirit, mounted a monumental campaign to rescue the series after it had been cancelled. Fans posted a barrage of videos on You Tube and deluged the studio with peanuts (the significance is explained in the season finale). \"What is it about this town that has you so addicted to it?\" someone asks Emily at one point. Just watch a couple of episodes, and you'll also be hooked.

Amazon.com The interns of Sacred Heart hospital move up to residents in the second season of Scrubs , the dorky little brother to ER with more than a passing resemblance to Ally McBeal . But in this season the sitcom actually matures-- in a good way--in its ability to balance just the right amount of heart and humor. While JD (Zach Braff) wrestles with his feelings for Elliot (Sarah Chalke), Elliot bends over backwards to be included with her colleagues and friends alike (after a character rags on JD and Turk, she squeals, \"Do me!\"), Turk (Donald Faison) proposes to Carla (Judy Reyes), and Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley) reunites with his ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller), who's carrying his child. The cast melds together nicely, but it's Braff, executing most of the fantasy sequences, who's the real comic find, although he's nearly upstaged (in a welcome bit of stunt casting) by Tom Cavanaugh as JD's irresponsible older brother, a complete departure from his role on Ed . Season Two's bonus features include some very revealing episode commentary by creator Bill Lawrence and various cast members, who all describe guest star Rick Schroder as \"an odd dude\" and make fun of his imploring the cast not to call him Ricky. They also spend a curious part of time studying the female anatomy, from Chalke's bra colors to guest star Heather Locklear's derriere to Miller's bust (this observation comes from Lawrence, who is Miller's husband). Braff's fame after Garden State also comes as an easy target in the commentaries, as well as the network's inability to understand the show, such as asking to remove an episode's reference to the Wonder Twins because they didn't know who they were.

Four years later, he ends up with a crappy job in Pizza Chain. Then, he gets an offer to get back in the game as the chef of a famous restaurant. Amazon.com Having been described as \"wicked\" and \"debauched,\" Anthony Bourdain's culinary memoir was bound to be a tough sell for network TV. In Kitchen Confidential 's sitcom incarnation, dark-haired Anthony becomes blond, blue-eyed Jack (Bradley Cooper). In the pilot, the recovering alcoholic moves from a pizzeria to a brasserie. The catch is that he has to hire a staff in 48 hours, so he turns to pastry expert Seth (Nicholas Brendon, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ), seafood genius Teddy (John Cho, Smiley Face ), and sous-chef Steven (Owain Yeoman). He also inherits kitchen worker Jim (John Francis Daley, Freaks and Geeks ). In reality, Bourdain ran the shop at New York's celebrated Les Halles. In the show, Jack oversees the kitchen at the fictional Nolita. Pino (Frank Langella, terrific as usual) manages the joint, while the wait staff includes his tightly-wound daughter, Mimi (Bonnie Somerville, NYPD Blue ) and the bubble-headed Tanya (Jaime King, Pearl Harbor ). As in producer Darren Star's Sex and the City , the central character narrates, there's no laugh track, and more of the comedy revolves around sex than work. While Cooper ( The Wedding Crashers ) isn't the most obvious choice to play Bourdain--and although Kitchen Confidential would've made more sense on cable--he does a surprisingly credible job, even if the writing lets him down on occasion. Realistic or not, severed fingers and singed eyebrows tend to play better in print than on the screen. Of the 13 episodes produced, FOX only aired four (back-to-back with Arrested Development ), which is a shame as it was just starting to hit its stride. Guest stars include Bitty Schram (\"Exile on Main Street\"), John Larroquette (\"Dinner Date with Death\"), and Cooper's Alias co-star Michael Vartan (\"French Fight\"). --Kathleen C. Fennessy \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I'm getting on 70 years, and this show reminds me of Italian Sex Comedies of the 60's and 70's. Think sexy women (updated to make them as hungry and capable as men) and goofy male types thrown together like a chef's salad of salacious double-entres and screwball situations.<br />If you're willing to just laugh at this fast-food of sexy modernity, with the always willing Bradley Cooper fully in hunk mode, it's a fine time filler for evenings when you don't want to get serious. Also, a bargain DVD.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I enjoy timeless romantic classics, and I'm always looking for sophisticated entertainment, so I'd love to discover new films that capture the essence of celebrated love stories.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

The show is really amazingly well done, and now, I guess, in this day of declining chimp and ape population in the wild (DUE TO THE CRAZY APE, HUMANS) ... this kinda show will never be done again.-------\nItem title: Kitchen Confidential - The Complete Series \n Item description: Product Description Jack Bourdain had it all but messed it up going wild. Four years later, he ends up with a crappy job in Pizza Chain. Then, he gets an offer to get back in the game as the chef of a famous restaurant. Amazon.com Having been described as \"wicked\" and \"debauched,\" Anthony Bourdain's culinary memoir was bound to be a tough sell for network TV. In Kitchen Confidential 's sitcom incarnation, dark-haired Anthony becomes blond, blue-eyed Jack (Bradley Cooper). In the pilot, the recovering alcoholic moves from a pizzeria to a brasserie. The catch is that he has to hire a staff in 48 hours, so he turns to pastry expert Seth (Nicholas Brendon, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ), seafood genius Teddy (John Cho, Smiley Face ), and sous-chef Steven (Owain Yeoman). He also inherits kitchen worker Jim (John Francis Daley, Freaks and Geeks ). In reality, Bourdain ran the shop at New York's celebrated Les Halles. In the show, Jack oversees the kitchen at the fictional Nolita. Pino (Frank Langella, terrific as usual) manages the joint, while the wait staff includes his tightly-wound daughter, Mimi (Bonnie Somerville, NYPD Blue ) and the bubble-headed Tanya (Jaime King, Pearl Harbor ). As in producer Darren Star's Sex and the City , the central character narrates, there's no laugh track, and more of the comedy revolves around sex than work. While Cooper ( The Wedding Crashers ) isn't the most obvious choice to play Bourdain--and although Kitchen Confidential would've made more sense on cable--he does a surprisingly credible job, even if the writing lets him down on occasion. Realistic or not, severed fingers and singed eyebrows tend to play better in print than on the screen. Of the 13 episodes produced, FOX only aired four (back-to-back with Arrested Development ), which is a shame as it was just starting to hit its stride. Guest stars include Bitty Schram (\"Exile on Main Street\"), John Larroquette (\"Dinner Date with Death\"), and Cooper's Alias co-star Michael Vartan (\"French Fight\"). --Kathleen C. Fennessy \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I'm getting on 70 years, and this show reminds me of Italian Sex Comedies of the 60's and 70's. Think sexy women (updated to make them as hungry and capable as men) and goofy male types thrown together like a chef's salad of salacious double-entres and screwball situations.<br />If you're willing to just laugh at this fast-food of sexy modernity, with the always willing Bradley Cooper fully in hunk mode, it's a fine time filler for evenings when you don't want to get serious. Also, a bargain DVD.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I enjoy timeless romantic classics, and I'm always looking for sophisticated entertainment, so I'd love to discover new films that capture the essence of celebrated love stories.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Black Snake Moan \n Description: Product Description In this tale of love, loss and faith, Academy Award nominee Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci seek redemption Down South through the power of the blues and the transcendence of an unlikely friendship. Amazon.com The lurid scenario--a nymphomaniacal white trash nymphet (Christina Ricci) is held prisoner by a bitter bluesman (Samuel L. Jackson)--gives way to an affecting tale of redemption in Black Snake Moan , writer/director Craig Brewer's follow-up to the acclaimed Hustle & Flow . Lazarus (Jackson, Jungle Fever , Pulp Fiction ) finds Rae (Ricci, Monster , The Ice Storm ) beaten unconscious on the road in front of his backwoods house. After bringing her inside, he learns of her wanton ways and decides to exorcise his own demons by curing Rae of her sexual compulsion. Black Snake Moan could have been terrible, but Brewer takes his story seriously enough to dig into the genuine emotions of such a situation (though along the way he certainly flirts with sexploitation overtones--several scenes look like they were plucked straight out of a hitherto unknown 1970s trash classic). Ricci, Jackson, and the supporting cast (including pop star Justin Timberlake, giving a surprisingly good performance as Rae's boyfriend) treat the characters with respect, honesty, and humor. The result is off-kilter and maybe a little too fond of its sleazy cinematic forbears to truly hit the emotional notes it's after, but Black Snake Moan has considerably more substance than its marketing would suggest. --Bret Fetzer Beyond Black Snake Moan The Soundtrack More Music Stars on DVD More DVDs with Samuel L.

Amazon.com Based on the bestseller by John Grisham, Runaway Jury is a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison to The Insider ) in a riveting expos\u00e9 of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 3.0 \n review: The movie is a good production, good acting and all but for some reason it lacks overall punch or appeal and once seen, it will probably end up just collecting dust.

The Earth is infested with alien spirits, and mankind faces total extinction. Led by a strange dream and guided by her mentor, Dr. Sid, scientist Aki Ross struggles to collect eight spirits in the hope of creating a force powerful enough to destroy the alien presence and pure enough to protect the planet. With the aid of the Deep Eyes Squadron, Aki must save the Earth from its darkest hate and unleash the final spirit. FINAL FANTASY is the groundbreaking new CGI film from the creators of the Final Fantasy Video Game Franchise. 2016 release The year is 2065. A meteor has crashed into Earth, unleashing millions of alien creatures who roam the planet, decimating field and city alike, threatening to extinguish life itself. Prepare to be spellbound by an amazing woman, the brave individuals at her side and an astounding mission to save the Earth. Set Contains: The special edition DVD of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within can keep you occupied for hours. The first disc includes two feature-length commentaries. The first was recorded by co-director Motonori Sakakibara, sequence supervisor Hiroyuki Hayashida, sets and props lead artist Tatsuro Maruyama, and Phantom supervisor Takao Noguchi the day after the film was finished. They speak Japanese so you might have to read subtitles, but it's fun to hear them laugh as they enjoy the film. The second commentary, which is less giddy and more informative (and in English), is by animation director Andy Jones, editor Chris S. Capp, and staging director Tani Kunitake, who discuss technical elements of the animation, notes on the casting, and subtle details you might not have noticed. There's also an isolated version of the powerful score with infrequent but interesting comments from composer Elliot Goldenthal, and 11 scenes (81 minutes total) that alternate among storyboard, rough animation, and final film, with optional filmmaker commentary or subtitled factoids. The bulk of the second disc is a 30-minute making-of documentary supplemented by numerous easy-to-find Easter eggs. There are also profiles of the seven major characters (including personal background, as well as voice actor and lead animator info), sketches and explications of three of the film's vehicles, DVD-ROM content, and an editing tool that allows the viewer to rearrange parts of the council-conference scene and play them back. Even the menu intros are interesting to watch! --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Loved this movie. The plot was great at the beginning but towards the end it gets a little spoiled by the excessive melodrama. Animation is absolutely fantastic but I feel the producers and director should have focused a bit more on the storyline and characters. Animation is not what makes a movie great. Why the five stars then? Because the flaws aren't significant enough for me to stop me from considering this movie a cornerstone in cinematography. Everything you see, hear and experience is done from scratch using technology.-------\nItem title: What Dreams May Come \n Item description: Academy Award-winners Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. embark on a supernatural journey beyond the realm of mortality in this visually stunning and unforgettable epic.

A touching story filled with drama, despair and hope. A not-so-new idea of what heaven and hell could be is transformed into a unique vision with the aid of astonishing visual effects.<br />The movie could have been a bit better with a slightly different cast, most noticeably either another actress as Robin William's great love Annie, or Robin himself replaced by someone else. Acting isn't quite Oscar-worthy but convincing enough.<br />All in all, like I said, I personally found this movie wonderful. It's one of the few titles I own that I go back every now and then and watch it again.-------\nItem title: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon \n Item description: Product Description Named \"Best Picture of the Year\" by over 100 critics nationwide! Two master warriors (Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh) are faced with their greatest challenge when the treasured Green Destiny sword isstolen. A young aristocrat (Zhang Ziyi) prepares for an arranged marriage, but soon reveals her superior fighting talents and her deeply romantic past. As each warrior battles for justice, they come face to face with their worst enemy - and the inescapable, enduring power of love. Set against 19th-century China's breathtaking landscape, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is the action-packed, box office smash from acclaimed director Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm) featuring stunning martial arts choreography by Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix). 2016 release Two master warriors (Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh) are faced with their greatest challenge when the treasured Green Destiny sword isstolen. A young aristocrat (Zhang Ziyi) prepares for an arranged marriage, but soon reveals her su Amazon.com Hong Kong wuxia films, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watching wuxia films as a youngster and made Crouching Tiger as a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau ( The Killer , The Bride with White Hair ) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work on The Matrix . Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other. The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity. --Eugene Wei \n rating: 4.0 \n review: At first glance I didn't understand how the characters, who were supposed to be martial arts experts could defy gravity by jumping 50 feet in the air and bounce from tree branch to tree branch with more ease than a monkey. It's metaphoric. You will realize the movie is a lot deeper than it seems, a true work of art. Artistic, captivating, dramatic.-------\nItem title: Get Shorty \n Item description:  \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is one of the few movies I own that I can watch again and again.

Better than van Helsing. If you compare the movie to the characters out of the books which it depicts you'll probably be disapointed, so take it for what it is. A movie that drives to entertain the masses, not to satisfy the bookworms [no offense to anybody here. I happen to be one also]-------\nItem title: The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition) \n Item description: Product Description Epic Action Drama. Set in Japan during the 1870s, The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a respected American military officer hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country's first army in the art of modern warfare. As the Emperor attempts to eradicate the ancient Imperial Samurai warriors in preparation for more Westernized and trade-friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him. Set Contains: No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable. --Doug Thomas \n rating: 5.0 \n review: The Last Samurai is an inspiring, artistic, touching movie. It even manages to stay pretty close to the historical facts it's based on.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is anything but new, even so, it's a unique production. It offers insight into the japanese culture and we, the audience, take it in through the senses of the main character, Nathan Allgren [Tom Cruise]. We learn about the samurai, honor, trust, pursuit of perfection and harmony, discipline and tradition, all adjectives that make Japan what it is today.<br /><br />There are a couple of things however that I personally would have liked to have seen changed. A bit more action and a bit less philosophy and talk [less gab, more shooting one might say].<br /><br />The last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action. It was a bit over the top compared to the rest of the movie which was realistic and down-to-earth.<br /><br />Almost forgot to mention the movie's soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant, the tracks are a combination of japanese traditional music and western music. Beautiful.<br /><br />All in all, I absolutely loved this movie and is now part of my DVD collection. It's one of the few titles I would enjoy watching again once in a while.-------\nItem title: Dungeons & Dragons \n Item description: Dungeons & Dragons (New Line Pl \n rating: 2.0 \n review: I did not like this movie one bit. Actors are unconvincing, the storyline is extremely banal, bad costumes [you can tell they're made for a movie, not a single ounce of realism]. It wasn't worth the $5 I spent on it. There is loads of better fantasy movies out there, you're probably better of not wasting your time with this one.-------\nItem title: Equilibrium \n Item description: Product Description Delivering awesome high-tech action in the power-packed style of THE MATRIX and MINORITY REPORT, EQUILIBRIUM stars Christian Bale (REIGN OF FIRE) and Taye Diggs (CHICAGO) in a thrilling look at a future where the only crime is being human! In an attempt to end wars and maintain peace, humankind has outlawed the things that trigger emotion -- literature, music, and art. To uphold the law, a special breed of police is assigned to eliminate all transgressors. But when the top enforcer (Bale) misses a dose of an emotion-blocking drug, he begins to realize that things are not as they seem! Also starring Sean Bean (THE LORD OF THE RINGS) and Emily Watson (RED DRAGON). Amazon.com A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein, Equilibrium takes a respectable stab at a Fahrenheit 451 -like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic, Metropolis -influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), but Equilibrium should be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Christian Bale, the main character in the movie Equilibrium should have definitely been Neo in the Matrix trilogy.<br />Equilibrium's premise is almost the same as Orwell's book called 1984.<br />In a future world, emotion and anything that might trigger any kind of emotion is outlawed and destroyed. Art is burned. People that are caught having any sort of feelings are instantly sentenced to death. The masses are being brainwashed, being taught that feeling is the mother of chaos, of suffering, of war and destruction.<br />Action scenes? Forget the Matrix! Cleric's moves will leave you dumbstruck.<br />Great movie, great plot, great action. I recommend it to everyone.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey recommender system, I'm craving a new martial arts movie with some great fighting scenes - got anything in mind for me?\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), but Equilibrium should be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Christian Bale, the main character in the movie Equilibrium should have definitely been Neo in the Matrix trilogy.<br />Equilibrium's premise is almost the same as Orwell's book called 1984.<br />In a future world, emotion and anything that might trigger any kind of emotion is outlawed and destroyed. Art is burned. People that are caught having any sort of feelings are instantly sentenced to death. The masses are being brainwashed, being taught that feeling is the mother of chaos, of suffering, of war and destruction.<br />Action scenes? Forget the Matrix! Cleric's moves will leave you dumbstruck.<br />Great movie, great plot, great action. I recommend it to everyone.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey recommender system, I'm craving a new martial arts movie with some great fighting scenes - got anything in mind for me?\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

About the Director Director Jim Wynorski grew up in Long Island, New York. He flunked out of film school and went to work at the fiction department of DoubleDay publishing from 1972 to 1977. He wanted to work in movies, so quit his job and moved to Los Angeles. He got a job as location manager on the TV show 'Breaking Away', but was fired during production. Flying back to Los Angeles, he met a fellow passenger who knew Roger Corman and arranged an introduction. Wynorski went to work for Corman. He did publicity and began writing screenplays. Jim Wynorski's first produced screenplay was Forbidden World (1982). He also wrote Sorceress for $1,000 and wrote and produced Screwballs (1983), a Porky's style comedy. Wynorski made his directing debut with The Lost Empire. His second film, Chopping Mall (1986), was made for Julie Corman, which Wynorski also produced and co-wrote. Julie's husband Corman liked it, and hired Wynorski to make Deathstalker 2 in Argentina, then Big Bad Mama II (1987) with Angie Dickinson, and a remake of Not of this Earth (1988) with Traci Lords. Following Not of this Earth, Wynorski was given a $7 million budget to make The Return of Swamp Thing (1989) with Louis Jourdan. He then made Transylvania Twist and The Haunting of Morella back to back for Roger Corman. He also made Sorority House Massacre II (1990) for Julie Corman, on sets left over from existing films. Roger Corman was impressed and got Wynorski to remake it as Sorority House Massacre III: Hard to Die. Corman \"taught me all the lessons on how to make a film and how to make it look expensive when you don't have a lot of money,\" Wynorski says. He worked on the scripts for Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time (1991), House IV (1992) and Final Embrace (1992) but did not direct them.

An NYC cop visiting his estranged wife in LA must save her and the rest of her company from terrorists who have taken over her office building. 1988/color/131 min/R. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: The original Die Hard is a classic film that is required viewing for action junkies.  The story follows John McClain, a NY police officer visiting his wife in California for the holidays.  Their relationship is on the rocks and he is trying to smooth things over in time for Christmas.  But his marital affairs turn out to be the least of his worries as he soon discovers that European terrorists have hijacked the building.  As everyone is quarantined and held hostage in the lobby, McClain escapes their wrath and finds himself alone.  He knows what he must do and he uses his extensive skills (combined with a bit of luck and directorial favors) to rise to the challenge and neutralize the situation.<br /><br />The film is very well crafted and contains something for everyone.  It is surprising just how well this film has held up over the years.  It's still a highly enjoyable, tense, action-packed thrill ride.  This film is a timeless masterpiece of the genre.-------\nItem title: Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in this thrilling, action-packed adventure that picks up where Casino Royale left off. Betrayed by the woman he loved, 007 fights the urge to make his latest mission personal. On a nonstop quest for justice that crisscrosses the globe, Bond meets the beautiful but feisty Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who leads him to Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a ruthless businessman and major force within the mysterious Quantum organization. When Bond uncovers a conspiracy to take control of one of the world\u2019s most important natural resources, he must navigate a minefield of treachery, deception and murder to neutralize Greene before it\u2019s too late! \n rating: 2.0 \n review: The movie is miscalculated and suffers from a weak screenplay and a dull plot which relies much too heavily on its predecessor.  The movie tries to faithfully continue where \"Casino Royale\" left off, which is the films biggest mistake.  The result is a movie which seems unoriginal and weighed down considerably by its own plot.  The movie never gets to become its own film.  It is anchored too deeply to the past.  The story suffers immensely because it gets too confusing to remember all the little plot points from its predecessor.  More importantly -- we don't bother to.  The film never gets any lift.  It never engages us.  The action sequences seem artificial and out of place.  The villain is lackluster and his \"evil scheme\" is pretty pathetic.  The climax was ridiculously poor.  This is just not an entertaining film.  It should have been a standalone movie - plain and simple.  The action sequences were almost laughable at times.  The Dark Knight has spoiled me and makes films like this look like the final project of a high-school film class.  Skip it and wait for the next one which has some promise as it will be a standalone movie.-------\nItem title: Cars (Single-Disc Full Screen Edition) \n Item description: Product Description From the acclaimed creators of TOY STORY, THE INCREDIBLES, and FINDING NEMO comes a high-octane adventure comedy that shows life is about the journey, not the finish line. Hotshot rookie race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is living life in the fast lane until he hits a detour on his way to the most important race of his life. Stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten town on the old Route 66, he meets Sally, Mater, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), and a variety of quirky characters who help him discover that there's more to life than trophies and fame. Revved up with a sensational soundtrack, featuring Rascal Flatts, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, James Taylor, and others, plus exciting bonus features, including the exclusive short movie \"Mater And The Ghostlight,\" CARS is full of freewheeling fun for everyone. Set Contains: With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD, Cars still shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version). Not a tricked-out DVD, but still worth a spin. --Doug Thomas Cars at Amazon.com More Cars Merchandise at Amazon.com All Pixar Feature Films on DVD See What's at Our Disney Store \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Pixar is really at the top of their game.  Cars is a unique animated film that highlights how the negative emotions such as greed and lust will ultimately lead to displeasure and misery in life.  It's a bit ironic that the film's main message is to avoid being materialistic, yet Disney is probably the most commercialized company on the planet.  Never mind that though, because this truly is a great movie.<br /><br />The film has a wide range of celebrity voices.  It centers around a hot-rod race car that stumbles into a quaint suburban town on the verge of extinction.  Lightning McQueen condemns the residents and believes the town has nothing to offer him.  Of course, he learns the value of friendship, cooperation, and geniality in the end as they help him win his final big race.  The plot is predictable but it doesn't matter;  it's the journey along the way that is excellent.  The film is dripping with oddball characters.  The film has a lot of humor that is appropriate for all ages.<br /><br />It's a sensational, albeit predictable, film that inevitably charms and dazzles everyone in the audience.-------\nItem title: Live Free or Die Hard (Unrated Edition) \n Item description: Product Description John McClane takes on an Internet-based terrorist organization who is systematically shutting down the United States. Amazon.com Twelve years after Die Hard with a Vengeance , the third and previous film in the Die Hard franchise, Live Free or Die Hard finds John McClane (Bruce Willis) a few years older, not any happier, and just as kick-ass as ever. Right after he has a fight with his college-age daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a call comes in to pick up a hacker (Justin Long, a.k.a. the \"Apple guy\") who might help the FBI learn something about a brief security blip in their systems. Now any Die Hard fan knows that this is when the assassins with foreign accents and high-powered weaponry show up, telling McClane that once again he's stumbled into an assignment that's anything but routine. Once that wreckage has cleared, it is revealed that the hacker is only one of many hackers who are being targeted for extermination after they helped set up a \"fire sale,\" a three-pronged cyberattack designed to bring down the entire country by crippling its transportation, finances, and utilities. That plan is now being put into action by a mysterious team (Timothy Olyphant, Deadwood , and Maggie Q, Mission: Impossible 3 ) that seems to be operating under the government's noses. Live Free or Die Hard uses some of the cat-and-mouse elements of Die Hard with a Vengeance along with some of the pick-'em-off-one-by-one elements of the now-classic original movie. And it's the most consistently enjoyable installment of the franchise since the original, with eye-popping stunts (directed by Len Wiseman of the Underworld franchise), good humor, and Willis's ability to toss off a quip while barely alive. There was some controversy over the film's PG-13 rating--there might be less blood than usual, and McClane's famous tag line is somewhat obscured--but there's still has plenty of action and a high body count. Yippee-ki-ay! -- David Horiuchi Beyond Live Free or Die Hard Live Free or Die Hard on Blu-Ray Top U.S. Box Office of 2007 More from Fox Stills from Live Free or Die Hard (click for larger image) > > > > > > \n rating: 4.0 \n review: If you've seen any of the other Die Hard films, you understand the general premise related to the movies.  McClain is essentially an unstoppable force on a mission to destroy as many baddies as possible.<br /><br />This film is no different, but provides a new and prevalent modern threat:  cyber-terrorism!  Hackers have infiltrated the bureaucracy and are doing their best to unravel the very fabric that our society is built upon:  computer networks.  Nothing is off-limits for these hackers -- traffic lights, financial records, television broadcasts, etc.  The goal is to initiate a \"fire sale\", which is basically a three step plan to cause complete and total anarchy among the public.<br /><br />While this sounds preposterous, it's actually very cool because the threat seems very real and very scary due to our modern hyper-networked, computer dependent world.<br /><br />This film is well-crafted and delivers an exciting ride, but goes a bit too far in terms of McClain being invincible.  Some things in the film were just a bit too outlandish to be taken seriously; even more-so than any of the past Die Hard films.  The problem was that this caused a discord between two important film elements.  On the one hand, you have this ultra-realistic and frightening threat of hackers dismantling society as we know it.  As an audience, we can connect with that nowadays.  On the other hand, we witness impossible scene after impossible scene in which McClain escapes near death again and again.  Most of the time, it was meant as humor in the first place.  And it works because this film borders on a comedy at times.  But certain scenes were not intended as comedy, yet they make us chuckle at just how preposterous they really are.  This isn't necessarily a flaw with the film.  If you've seen any of the past films, you know that they can be a bit outlandish.  You just have to suspend your disbelief and you are good to go.  The problem, as I stated earlier, was that the film oscillated between humor and seriousness during some of these preposterous scenes, and the differences caused a discord in which we could not really tell them apart at times.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great film.  I enjoyed it immensely in the theater at the times of its release.  Lots and lots of humor and some over-the-top action.  I will revisit it soon.-------\nItem title: Die Hard with a Vengeance \n Item description: Suspended from the police force, John McClane enlists a Harlem shopkeeper to help stop a terrorist bomber. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Delivers fine action sequences and plenty of humor.  The main plot driving force is the enigmatic villain played by Jeremy Irons, who does a fantastic job as he dishes out riddle after riddle for the soon exasperated John McClain.  Samuel Jackson does a good job as the innocent passerby who gets caught up in the act and has to help McClain along the way.<br /><br />If you want a smooth action flick that is fairly intelligent and funny, then you can't go wrong with Die Hard with a Vengeance.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I enjoy action movies with a mix of humor and well-known actors, so I'm looking for something entertaining and engaging with a good cast.

The story follows John McClain, a NY police officer visiting his wife in California for the holidays.  Their relationship is on the rocks and he is trying to smooth things over in time for Christmas.  But his marital affairs turn out to be the least of his worries as he soon discovers that European terrorists have hijacked the building.  As everyone is quarantined and held hostage in the lobby, McClain escapes their wrath and finds himself alone.  He knows what he must do and he uses his extensive skills (combined with a bit of luck and directorial favors) to rise to the challenge and neutralize the situation.<br /><br />The film is very well crafted and contains something for everyone.  It is surprising just how well this film has held up over the years.  It's still a highly enjoyable, tense, action-packed thrill ride.  This film is a timeless masterpiece of the genre.-------Item title: Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray]  Item description: Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in this thrilling, action-packed adventure that picks up where Casino Royale left off. Betrayed by the woman he loved, 007 fights the urge to make his latest mission personal. On a nonstop quest for justice that crisscrosses the globe, Bond meets the beautiful but feisty Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who leads him to Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a ruthless businessman and major force within the mysterious Quantum organization. When Bond uncovers a conspiracy to take control of one of the world\u2019s most important natural resources, he must navigate a minefield of treachery, deception and murder to neutralize Greene before it\u2019s too late!  rating: 2.0  review: The movie is miscalculated and suffers from a weak screenplay and a dull plot which relies much too heavily on its predecessor.  The movie tries to faithfully continue where \"Casino Royale\" left off, which is the films biggest mistake.  The result is a movie which seems unoriginal and weighed down considerably by its own plot.  The movie never gets to become its own film.  It is anchored too deeply to the past.  The story suffers immensely because it gets too confusing to remember all the little plot points from its predecessor.  More importantly -- we don't bother to.  The film never gets any lift.  It never engages us.  The action sequences seem artificial and out of place.  The villain is lackluster and his \"evil scheme\" is pretty pathetic.  The climax was ridiculously poor.  This is just not an entertaining film.  It should have been a standalone movie - plain and simple.  The action sequences were almost laughable at times.  The Dark Knight has spoiled me and makes films like this look like the final project of a high-school film class.  Skip it and wait for the next one which has some promise as it will be a standalone movie.-------Item title: Cars (Single-Disc Full Screen Edition)  Item description: Product Description From the acclaimed creators of TOY STORY, THE INCREDIBLES, and FINDING NEMO comes a high-octane adventure comedy that shows life is about the journey, not the finish line. Hotshot rookie race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is living life in the fast lane until he hits a detour on his way to the most important race of his life. Stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten town on the old Route 66, he meets Sally, Mater, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), and a variety of quirky characters who help him discover that there's more to life than trophies and fame. Revved up with a sensational soundtrack, featuring Rascal Flatts, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, James Taylor, and others, plus exciting bonus features, including the exclusive short movie \"Mater And The Ghostlight,\" CARS is full of freewheeling fun for everyone. Set Contains: With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD, Cars still shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version). Not a tricked-out DVD, but still worth a spin. --Doug Thomas Cars at Amazon.com More Cars Merchandise at Amazon.com All Pixar Feature Films on DVD See What's at Our Disney Store  rating: 5.0  review: Pixar is really at the top of their game.  Cars is a unique animated film that highlights how the negative emotions such as greed and lust will ultimately lead to displeasure and misery in life.  It's a bit ironic that the film's main message is to avoid being materialistic, yet Disney is probably the most commercialized company on the planet.  Never mind that though, because this truly is a great movie.<br /><br />The film has a wide range of celebrity voices.  It centers around a hot-rod race car that stumbles into a quaint suburban town on the verge of extinction.  Lightning McQueen condemns the residents and believes the town has nothing to offer him.  Of course, he learns the value of friendship, cooperation, and geniality in the end as they help him win his final big race.  The plot is predictable but it doesn't matter;  it's the journey along the way that is excellent.  The film is dripping with oddball characters.  The film has a lot of humor that is appropriate for all ages.<br /><br />It's a sensational, albeit predictable, film that inevitably charms and dazzles everyone in the audience.-------Item title: Live Free or Die Hard (Unrated Edition)  Item description: Product Description John McClane takes on an Internet-based terrorist organization who is systematically shutting down the United States. Amazon.com Twelve years after Die Hard with a Vengeance , the third and previous film in the Die Hard franchise, Live Free or Die Hard finds John McClane (Bruce Willis) a few years older, not any happier, and just as kick-ass as ever. Right after he has a fight with his college-age daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a call comes in to pick up a hacker (Justin Long, a.k.a. the \"Apple guy\") who might help the FBI learn something about a brief security blip in their systems. Now any Die Hard fan knows that this is when the assassins with foreign accents and high-powered weaponry show up, telling McClane that once again he's stumbled into an assignment that's anything but routine. Once that wreckage has cleared, it is revealed that the hacker is only one of many hackers who are being targeted for extermination after they helped set up a \"fire sale,\" a three-pronged cyberattack designed to bring down the entire country by crippling its transportation, finances, and utilities. That plan is now being put into action by a mysterious team (Timothy Olyphant, Deadwood , and Maggie Q, Mission: Impossible 3 ) that seems to be operating under the government's noses. Live Free or Die Hard uses some of the cat-and-mouse elements of Die Hard with a Vengeance along with some of the pick-'em-off-one-by-one elements of the now-classic original movie. And it's the most consistently enjoyable installment of the franchise since the original, with eye-popping stunts (directed by Len Wiseman of the Underworld franchise), good humor, and Willis's ability to toss off a quip while barely alive. There was some controversy over the film's PG-13 rating--there might be less blood than usual, and McClane's famous tag line is somewhat obscured--but there's still has plenty of action and a high body count. Yippee-ki-ay! -- David Horiuchi Beyond Live Free or Die Hard Live Free or Die Hard on Blu-Ray Top U.S. Box Office of 2007 More from Fox Stills from Live Free or Die Hard (click for larger image) > > > > > >  rating: 4.0  review: If you've seen any of the other Die Hard films, you understand the general premise related to the movies.  McClain is essentially an unstoppable force on a mission to destroy as many baddies as possible.<br /><br />This film is no different, but provides a new and prevalent modern threat:  cyber-terrorism!  Hackers have infiltrated the bureaucracy and are doing their best to unravel the very fabric that our society is built upon:  computer networks.  Nothing is off-limits for these hackers -- traffic lights, financial records, television broadcasts, etc.  The goal is to initiate a \"fire sale\", which is basically a three step plan to cause complete and total anarchy among the public.<br /><br />While this sounds preposterous, it's actually very cool because the threat seems very real and very scary due to our modern hyper-networked, computer dependent world.<br /><br />This film is well-crafted and delivers an exciting ride, but goes a bit too far in terms of McClain being invincible.  Some things in the film were just a bit too outlandish to be taken seriously; even more-so than any of the past Die Hard films.  The problem was that this caused a discord between two important film elements.  On the one hand, you have this ultra-realistic and frightening threat of hackers dismantling society as we know it.  As an audience, we can connect with that nowadays.  On the other hand, we witness impossible scene after impossible scene in which McClain escapes near death again and again.  Most of the time, it was meant as humor in the first place.  And it works because this film borders on a comedy at times.  But certain scenes were not intended as comedy, yet they make us chuckle at just how preposterous they really are.  This isn't necessarily a flaw with the film.  If you've seen any of the past films, you know that they can be a bit outlandish.  You just have to suspend your disbelief and you are good to go.  The problem, as I stated earlier, was that the film oscillated between humor and seriousness during some of these preposterous scenes, and the differences caused a discord in which we could not really tell them apart at times.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great film.  I enjoyed it immensely in the theater at the times of its release.  Lots and lots of humor and some over-the-top action.  I will revisit it soon.-------Item title: Die Hard with a Vengeance  Item description: Suspended from the police force, John McClane enlists a Harlem shopkeeper to help stop a terrorist bomber.  rating: 4.0  review: Delivers fine action sequences and plenty of humor.  The main plot driving force is the enigmatic villain played by Jeremy Irons, who does a fantastic job as he dishes out riddle after riddle for the soon exasperated John McClain.  Samuel Jackson does a good job as the innocent passerby who gets caught up in the act and has to help McClain along the way.<br /><br />If you want a smooth action flick that is fairly intelligent and funny, then you can't go wrong with Die Hard with a Vengeance.-------```And here is the user's intention: I enjoy action movies with a mix of humor and well-known actors, so I'm looking for something entertaining and engaging with a good cast.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Tango and Cash \n Description: Product Description Framed and sent to prison, rival Los Angeles police detectives must work together to clear themselves. Amazon.com Another action flick from an unlikely source (wildly inconsistent Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky), buddy movie Tango & Cash teams Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell as bullet-dodging cops who get on each others' nerves while uniting against a slimy French drug kingpin (Jack Palance). Violent, profane, and packed with implausibilities, this is one of those big-budget, stunt-laden affairs that gets by on the charisma of its stars, and they almost pull it off. Tango & Cash was Stallone's first attempt to share the spotlight with another hero, and he's casually laid-back in his change-of-pace role (well, OK, it's not that change-of-pace), while Russell is equally enjoyable as Sly's well-coifed sidekick. Ridiculous all the way, this one is entertaining if only as a virtual catalog of action-movie clich\u00e9s. --Jeff Shannon",

Fun-loving son Bobby (Pamela Adlon) and \"nerd\" neighbor Connie (Lauren Tom) break up (albeit amicably). \"Renaissance woman\" Peggy (Kathy Najimy) stirs up rebellion at the local Renaissance Faire.

There's no two ways about it, as one Asian character looking for a token Caucasian observes in \"A Man Without a Country Club.\" Hank is \"super-white.\" In \"Bobby Goes Nuts,\" another classic episode (and the sixth season is loaded with them), Hank beams after Bobby beats up a bully at school, thanks, he believes, to \"good old American YMCA know-how.\" He is therefore shocked when he discovers that Bobby's been attending a self-defense class for women, and kicking his victims \"below the belt\" (while screaming, \"Let go of my purse\"). No matter how his sensibilities are offended, Hank manages to keep an open mind and heart.

Fun-loving son Bobby (Pamela Adlon) and \"nerd\" neighbor Connie (Lauren Tom) break up (albeit amicably). \"Renaissance woman\" Peggy (Kathy Najimy) stirs up rebellion at the local Renaissance Faire. Luanne (Brittany Murphy) becomes the unwitting member of a cult. Conspiracy theorist Dale (Johnny Hardwick) discovers his father working in a gay rodeo. Through it all, Hank Hill (series creator Mike Judge) struggles to hold on to his core beliefs. It's not easy. \"My wife lies to me, my beer company betrays me, Americans are giving Mexicans diarrhea,\" he complains in \"Beer and Loathing.\" \"What the hell's going on here?\" But not to worry. We can count on Hank, one of TV's few good men, not to waver. In the episode \"Joust Like a Woman,\" a season benchmark, he is a vigilant father. \"No tights, tassels, or skirts on the boy,\" he directs Luanne as he puts her in charge of the Renaissance Faire spending money, adding, to Bobby's disappointment, \"Oh, and no bells.\" And he is a devoted husband, accepting \"King Philip's\" (regally voiced by Alan Rickman) jousting challenge to defend Peggy's honor. \"No chump in a velvet costume is ever kickin' my ass,\" Hank declares. There's no two ways about it, as one Asian character looking for a token Caucasian observes in \"A Man Without a Country Club.\" Hank is \"super-white.\" In \"Bobby Goes Nuts,\" another classic episode (and the sixth season is loaded with them), Hank beams after Bobby beats up a bully at school, thanks, he believes, to \"good old American YMCA know-how.\" He is therefore shocked when he discovers that Bobby's been attending a self-defense class for women, and kicking his victims \"below the belt\" (while screaming, \"Let go of my purse\"). No matter how his sensibilities are offended, Hank manages to keep an open mind and heart. When aspiring comedian Bobby sells a joke to Branson's own Yakov Smirnoff in \"The Bluegrass Is Always Greener,\" Hank is compelled to admit, \"That is a good joke; it's Branson good.\" And this sixth season is great; it's King of the Hill great! --Donald Liebenson  rating: 5.0  review: Love this show.-------```And here is the user's intention: Hey there, recommend me that last movie you think I'd enjoy!Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

The bereaved father (played by a thoroughly unsympathetic Gerard Butler) looks to slick Philly prosecutor Nick Rice (a low-key Jamie Foxx) to see that they receive the maximum sentence. Instead, the murderer, Ames, testifies against his accomplice, Darby, who gets the chair, while he gets 10 years. Upon his release, Ames' mutilated body turns up in an abandoned warehouse, and all roads lead to Shelton. Rice attempts to defend him, but his client makes it impossible--Shelton wants to go to prison--so he does time, but then members of Rice\u2019s legal team start to die. The attorney suspects Shelton, but can't connect him to the crimes, so he races against the clock to save the lives of his assistant, Sarah (Leslie Bibb), D.A. Jonas (Bruce McGill), and his own wife and child. The movie may sound like a Yank reboot of the Japanese chiller Cure, in which an inmate kills from inside institutional walls, but plays more like a mash-up between The Silence of the Lambs, without the psychological complexity, and The Devil's Advocate, without the cynical giggles. F. Gary Gray got his start with hip-hop videos and urban action flicks, like Set It Off, until he hit the big time with his remake of The Italian Job.

        "ground_truth": "Title: The Lincoln Lawyer \n Description: Product Description In the gripping thriller \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer,\u201d Matthew McConaughey stars as Michael \u201cMick\u201d Haller, a slick, charismatic Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back of his Lincoln Continental sedan. Having spent most of his career defending petty, gutter- variety criminals, Mick unexpectedly lands the case of a lifetime: defending a rich Beverly Hills playboy (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of attempted murder. However, what initially appears to be a straightforward case with a big money pay-off swiftly develops into a deadly match between two masters of manipulation and a crisis of conscience for Haller. Amazon.com Smooth operator Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) zips around Los Angeles in his chauffeured Lincoln town car, cutting deals and finding clients on the road. Then he lands a doozy: a rich real-estate heir (Ryan Phillippe) accused of the brutal assault of an escort. At first, the case looks like a breeze, but odd details start nagging at Haller until he recognizes an ugly connection to an earlier case--and realizes he's been set up in the strangest way. There are some deep implausibilities in The Lincoln Lawyer , but they hardly matter. This is a movie that cruises on charm and smart casting, from McConaughey as a man whose glib polish is betrayed by a streak of doubt, down to the detectives (solid performances from Bryan Cranston, Michael Par\u00e9, Michaela Conlin, and others) and lowlifes (Katherine Moennig as an unlucky hooker, Shea Whigham as a lazy snitch) that flesh out the legal world. Every character pops out, clean and distinct; this sort of web-of-deceit story line, full of twists and turns, depends on the audience clearly connecting all the players. Some moments get overstated or maybe don't make complete sense, but the zippy pace carries the audience over those bumps. The Lincoln Lawyer could easily turn into a television series, a sort of Rockford Files -esque mixture of procedure and puzzle making. Also starring Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Frances Fisher, John Leguizamo, and Josh Lucas as the prosecuting attorney who gives McConaughey some competition in the chiseled-looks department. --Bret Fetzer",

Star race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and the incomparable tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) take their friendship on the road from Radiator Springs to exciting new places when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage! Experience all the fast-paced fun with an \"all-car\" cast -- plus enjoy two hilarious short films, \"Air Mater\" and \"Hawaiian Vacation.\" It's turbocharged action and thrills and \"even better than before,\" raves Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. Amazon.com Lightning McQueen (voice by Owen Wilson), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), Sally (Bonnie Hunt), and the rest of the gang from Radiator Springs return to the screen in this sequel to Pixar's Cars (2006). But instead of evoking a nostalgic vision of Route 66 through the American Southwest, director John Lasseter and his artists spoof James Bond films in a fast-paced adventure that mixes espionage and road racing. After a successful season on the track, Lightning is looking forward to some rest at home, but Mater gets him involved in an elaborate three-part international race sponsored by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) to promote his new synthetic auto fuel. While serving on Lightning's pit crew, Mater inadvertently gets mixed up with two British secret agent cars, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), who are investigating a plot to sabotage the race. Myriad complications ensue before Lightning and Mater get back to the (relative) peace of Radiator Springs. The Pixar artists clearly had a lot of fun spoofing locations in Tokyo, London, Paris, and the Italian Riviera, and creating auto versions of sumo wrestlers, kabuki actors, Queen Elizabeth II, and a doting Italian mother. The use of 3-D adds adrenaline to the racing sequences. Cars 2 lacks the emotional impact of Toy Story 2 , Up , and most of the other Pixar features, but that will do little to lessen its appeal to its target audience, boys who love cars, driving games, and car toys. Cars 2 is screening with Toy Story Toons: Hawaiian Vacation , a new short with Woody, Buzz, Barbie, Ken, and the rest of the Toy Story gang.

Alexander Nikolaevith Hell is an Iron Qwaser, one of many opposing factions of super-warriors who can each draw upon the power of an element and wield it as an almost unstoppable array of weapons. And unfortunately for Mafuyu, Alexander's faction is there to gather the mystical relics known collectively as the High Circuit, which puts her friends, family and school at ground zero in a battle for the fate of all mankind! But there's an even more disturbing twist, as Qwasers require a special liquid diet to manifest their powers, one provided by the women who serve as a Qwaser's partner.

Can this pair of anything but normal paranormal detectives solve the ultimate dead case files or will they end up in cold storage themselves?

But nothing can stop his impossible dream of playing football for Notre Dame. From the time he's a young boy, Rudy (Sean Astin) is determined to join the Fighting Irish. But his blue collar family only laughs at his ambitions - they know Rudy will follow his father and brothers to the local steel mill. And, for four long years after high school, he does just that. But some dreams won't die, as Rudy proves when he goes to heroic, occasionally hilarious, lengths to win admission to Notre Dame.

That's what awaits fans of Supernatural in its fifth and most epic season to date. The stumbles in plot or character that are typical to most long-running series are largely missing from this season (though some might consider the stunt casting of Paris Hilton as a pagan goddess in \"Hammer of the Gods\" as such); instead, there's a solid, complex, and entirely satisfying run of episodes, and even a pair of series highlights in \"Changing Channels\" and \"The Real Ghostbusters.\" The former finds heroes Sam and Dean (Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki) trapped in a TV-influenced netherworld populated by perverse small-screen archetypes, while the latter is a clever bit of meta-fiction involving a real ghost at a Supernatural fan convention, complete with Winchester brothers look-alikes. The other 20 episodes bounce between stand-alone adventures and the larger story at hand, which finds the brothers racing to collect the rings of the Four Horsemen, which will return Lucifer to his prison. This is fantasy storytelling for television at its best--broad in scope and heavy with special effects, but never forgetting that the core of the show is the relationship between Sam and Dean and their joint quest to rid the world of evil. Both are well represented here in a season that brings the show's main story line to its fitting and satisfying conclusion. Fans should also be pleased with most of the extras on the six-disc set for Season 5 . The most ambitious feature is the Apocalypse Survival Guide, hosted by Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver). Presented as a tour through Bobby's house, the guide gives viewers a detailed lowdown on the major players in the war against Satan, including the Horsemen, various demons, and the Man in Red himself. Navigating one's way through the interactive videos can be a challenge, as the layout requires viewers to constantly restart the disc in order to review certain videos, but for sheer informational content, it's hard to beat.

Can Mac and his new patrol partner, Sgt. Sam Wright, somehow join forces to help one another when it\u2019s impossible to look past their differences\u2014especially the most obvious one? Every day, we have the opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal wounds by extending and receiving God\u2019s grace. Offer The Grace Card \u2026 and never underestimate the power of God\u2019s love. The Grace Card stars Michael Joiner, Michael Higgenbottom and Academy Award Winner, Louis Gossett Jr. Amazon.com A Christian film about grace and forgiveness, The Grace Card tackles prejudice, loss, and grief. The death of a child 17 years ago filled Mac's heart with anger and bigotry and crippled his relationship with his wife and youngest son. In his job as a policeman, he's paired up with Sam, a black officer who's also a part-time preacher and whom Mac dislikes intensely. Sam has also just received the promotion Mac thinks he deserved himself. The difficult partnership affects each man and his family in very different and significant ways. Sam struggles with the conflict between his desire as a minister to love and accept everyone, and his intense feelings of anger and even hate toward his fellow officer. That struggle almost turns him away from his calling as a preacher. A crisis on the job threatens to decimate what's left of Mac's family and brings the conflict between Mac and Sam to a climax. Just when the situation looks like it might destroy both men, a few well-chosen words and a seeming coincidence reveal that God has made Sam's and Mac's paths cross for a reason. What's more, their interaction with one another causes both men to experience a personal and spiritual growth that neither could have anticipated. The expressions of bigotry in the film are hard to stomach, the sermonizing may be off-putting to some, and the events are sometimes quite predictable, but the portrayal of a city torn in half by racial prejudice is compelling and the message that forgiveness, rather than justice, offers the best solution is certainly worth considering. --Tami Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: My family & I enjoyed the movie.

Disenchanted single mom Jennifer Cullen (Brooke Burns) is a Scroogette when it comes to anything Christmas. In fact, even her six-year-old son, Brian, is having trouble believing in Santa Claus. But when her Uncle Ralph (Henry Winkler) visits and brings a fellow passenger from his flight named Morgan Derby (Warren Christie), Jennifer s dubious heart awakens to the possibility that perhaps Christmas really does hold miracles. It s uplifting and laugh-packed and a story that will inspire the whole family to believe. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Nice product. It was a Christmas gift.-------\nItem title: The Grace Card \n Item description: Product Description After police officer Mac McDonald loses his son in an accident, years of bitterness and pain erodes his love for his family and leaves him angry with God \u2026 and everyone else. Can Mac and his new patrol partner, Sgt. Sam Wright, somehow join forces to help one another when it\u2019s impossible to look past their differences\u2014especially the most obvious one? Every day, we have the opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal wounds by extending and receiving God\u2019s grace. Offer The Grace Card \u2026 and never underestimate the power of God\u2019s love. The Grace Card stars Michael Joiner, Michael Higgenbottom and Academy Award Winner, Louis Gossett Jr. Amazon.com A Christian film about grace and forgiveness, The Grace Card tackles prejudice, loss, and grief. The death of a child 17 years ago filled Mac's heart with anger and bigotry and crippled his relationship with his wife and youngest son. In his job as a policeman, he's paired up with Sam, a black officer who's also a part-time preacher and whom Mac dislikes intensely. Sam has also just received the promotion Mac thinks he deserved himself. The difficult partnership affects each man and his family in very different and significant ways. Sam struggles with the conflict between his desire as a minister to love and accept everyone, and his intense feelings of anger and even hate toward his fellow officer. That struggle almost turns him away from his calling as a preacher. A crisis on the job threatens to decimate what's left of Mac's family and brings the conflict between Mac and Sam to a climax. Just when the situation looks like it might destroy both men, a few well-chosen words and a seeming coincidence reveal that God has made Sam's and Mac's paths cross for a reason. What's more, their interaction with one another causes both men to experience a personal and spiritual growth that neither could have anticipated. The expressions of bigotry in the film are hard to stomach, the sermonizing may be off-putting to some, and the events are sometimes quite predictable, but the portrayal of a city torn in half by racial prejudice is compelling and the message that forgiveness, rather than justice, offers the best solution is certainly worth considering. --Tami Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: My family & I enjoyed the movie.  I love how message is about  forgiveness & Grace.  This is an awesome ministry tool to help show how God forgives us & show us His Mercy & Grace everyday.-------\nItem title: A Christmas Detour \n Item description: Two New York City-bound travelers find themselves inextricably linked when a snowstorm reroutes them to an airport hotel in Buffalo.

Featuring an unequalled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood.

Closely based on Paul Brickhill's book, the various escape attempts, scrounging, forging, and ferreting activities are authentically realized thanks also to technical advisor Wally Flood, one of the original tunnel-digging POWs.

Produced by a family of thirteen, ABC Say It With Me \u2013 Bible Memory Verses teaches children of all ages (and adults too!) a KJV memory verse for each letter of the alphabet. But that\u2019s not all! Each letter also has a corresponding one to two minute vignette showing the verse put into practice. For example, In \u201cB\u201d a brother learns to be kind by sharing with his little sister. In \u201cD\u201d children are encouraged to pick up their toys without complaining. In \u201cH\u201d children are shown practical ways to honor their parents. In \u201cT\u201d a 13 year-old brother takes time to read the Bible to his younger siblings. In \"Y\" a young lady and her family are the \"light of the world\" to a harried restaurant waiter! Filled with delightful music and endearing scenes of home, farm, and family life, ABC Say It With Me promotes family unity, Scriptural truths, and, most importantly , the gospel message of Jesus Christ.

Just enough to pull off his act and to make some money at the gambling tables, so long as he's discreet. Unfortunately, he hasn't been discreet enough; a government agent (Julianne Moore) has sussed out his precognitive talent and wants to use him to track down terrorists. But all Johnson cares about is a beautiful young woman (Jessica Biel, The Illusionist ) that he can see in his future--much further in his future than he's ever seen before.

Episode 3: \u201cRedemption\u201d Prior Philip and Percy\u2019s son William find themselves in a political stalemate as they compete for access to valuable stone. Jack demonstrates amazing artistic prowess as he begins to carve a monument to St. Adolphus and the destroyed Kingsbridge Cathedral. \u201d Episode 4: \u201cBattlefield\u201d William plans his way towards Earldom and soon discovers he is not alone in his ambition; a mysterious knight seeks the same appointment. The battle between Maud and Stephen rages, culminating in hostages from each side being seized. Philip is tortured into confessing to the betrayal of Earl Bartholomew.  Episode 5: \u201cLegacy\u201d Tom attempts to mediate a camaraderie between Jack and his son, Alfred. However, their intense rivalry for the affection of Bartholomew\u2019s daughter, Aliena, proves too much of an obstacle.

There, Jason is charged with a monumental task: he must free the fabled warrior the Monkey King, who has been imprisoned by the powerful Jade War Lord. Jason is joined in his quest by wise kung fu master Lu Yan and a band of misfit warriors including Silent Monk. But only by learning the true precepts of kung fu can Jason hope to succeed - and find a way to get back home. Amazon.com Getting martial-arts superstars Jet Li and Jackie Chan together in the same action film is like a fantasy come true, even if The Forbidden Kingdom is more of a children's movie than an instant kung-fu classic. Yes, Li and Chan square off in a lengthy, acrobatic fight scene that is a lot of fun, though it can't be what such a scene might have been even a decade ago: careful editing now compensates for the 54-year-old Chan's slower moves and reflexes. Still, Chan doesn't disappoint as Lu Yan, a drunken immortal in ancient China who mentors a modern-day American kid, Jason (Michael Angarano), the latter having slipped into the past while in possession of a magical staff that belongs to the imprisoned Monkey King (Li). In order to get back to his own time and help an old friend (also Chan) wounded by thugs, Jason accompanies Lu Yan and a lovely warrior, Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei), on a journey to return the staff. Along the way, a (mostly) silent monk (Li, again), who has spent his life in search of the staff, joins their mission. He helps Lu Yan train Jason in fighting and adding more muscle to the party as it comes under siege from a violent witch (Li Bing Bing) and pathological warlord (Collin Chou). Screenwriter John Fusco (Hidalgo) and director Rob Minkoff (The Haunted Mansion) have made a slightly chintzy, Western version of a Chinese swords-and-sorcery tale. The gravity-defying, flying-through-the-air-while-fighting choreography looks pretty choppy and graceless compared to, say, the martial arts films of Zhang Yimou.

There, Jason is charged with a monumental task: he must free the fabled warrior the Monkey King, who has been imprisoned by the powerful Jade War Lord. Jason is joined in his quest by wise kung fu master Lu Yan and a band of misfit warriors including Silent Monk. But only by learning the true precepts of kung fu can Jason hope to succeed - and find a way to get back home. Amazon.com Getting martial-arts superstars Jet Li and Jackie Chan together in the same action film is like a fantasy come true, even if The Forbidden Kingdom is more of a children's movie than an instant kung-fu classic. Yes, Li and Chan square off in a lengthy, acrobatic fight scene that is a lot of fun, though it can't be what such a scene might have been even a decade ago: careful editing now compensates for the 54-year-old Chan's slower moves and reflexes. Still, Chan doesn't disappoint as Lu Yan, a drunken immortal in ancient China who mentors a modern-day American kid, Jason (Michael Angarano), the latter having slipped into the past while in possession of a magical staff that belongs to the imprisoned Monkey King (Li). In order to get back to his own time and help an old friend (also Chan) wounded by thugs, Jason accompanies Lu Yan and a lovely warrior, Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei), on a journey to return the staff. Along the way, a (mostly) silent monk (Li, again), who has spent his life in search of the staff, joins their mission. He helps Lu Yan train Jason in fighting and adding more muscle to the party as it comes under siege from a violent witch (Li Bing Bing) and pathological warlord (Collin Chou). Screenwriter John Fusco (Hidalgo) and director Rob Minkoff (The Haunted Mansion) have made a slightly chintzy, Western version of a Chinese swords-and-sorcery tale. The gravity-defying, flying-through-the-air-while-fighting choreography looks pretty choppy and graceless compared to, say, the martial arts films of Zhang Yimou.

As Lucy, a lonely subway worker, she becomes smitten with a handsome stranger (Peter Gallagher -- MALICE). But when she saves his life after he's been mugged and fallen into a coma, his hilariously offbeat family mistakes her for his fiancee! Soon, the mix-ups escalate as Lucy fabricates a life between herself and a man she's never met! And when Lucy falls for his charming brother (Bill Pullman -- INDEPENDENCE DAY) the situation really gets uproarious as she's forced to make a choice between the two! Amazon.com If you don't mind a heavy dose of schmaltz and sentiment, this romantic comedy has a gentle way of seducing you with its charms. While You Were Sleeping was the first starring role for Sandra Bullock after her blockbuster success in Speed . In a role that nicely emphasizes her easygoing appeal, Bullock is the reason the movie works at all. She plays Lucy Eleanor Moderatz, a Chicago Transit tollbooth clerk who's hopelessly smitten with a daily commuter, Peter Callaghan (Peter Gallagher). She saves the object of her affection from certain death after he's mugged and falls onto the train tracks. While Peter is in a coma, she lets his family believe that she is his fianc\u00e9e, and surprisingly finds herself drawn to his brother (Bill Pullman), for whom the attraction is definitely mutual. How Lucy gets out of this amorous predicament is what makes this pleasant movie less predictable than its familiar ingredients would initially indicate. It's feel-good fluff, with characters and performances that keep you smiling through the drippy plot mechanics. --Jeff Shannon",

Get ready to party with hours of exclusive bonus extras, including an inside look at the world of monsters and the animated theatrical short film \"The Blue Umbrella.\" Amazon.com Mike WazowskiMike Wazowski's lifelong dream is to become a Scarer at Monsters, Inc. and he's sure he knows just how to do it. Ever since he was a young monster, Mike's had his eye on Monsters University, home of the world's top Scare Program. Now a freshman and hopeful Scare student, he's well versed in the rich history, theory, and technique required to reach his goal, and the little green one-eyed monster has more confidence, enthusiasm, determination and heart than all of his classmates combined. But unexpected roadblocks derail Mike's plans and he's forced to team up with a group of misfit monsters and an unlikely ally to give it the old college try and pull off the biggest coup in the University's history. James P SullivanWhen it comes to Scaring, Sulley's a natural, his abundant size, fierce roar and family legacy of a long line of high-achieving Scarers make him a shoo-in for the esteemed Scare Program at Monsters University. But from the moment the overly confident monster steps his big furry feet on campus, it's clear he'd rather crack jokes than books and he learns the hard way that his unfettered talent and family ties can only get him so far. With his ego bruised and future in jeopardy, a stubborn Sulley must put his pride aside, team up with an odd bunch of misfit monsters and actually work if he wants to live up to his true Scaring potential. Randy BoggsMonsters University freshman Randy Boggs has big aspirations for college life. The peculiar lizard-like monster with his host of gangly arms and legs plans to major in Scaring and lead an active social life filled with fun, friends and fraternity parties. If only he could get his embarrassing disappearing habit under control, he'd be good to go, because how is he ever going to be a great Scarer if nobody can see him? Don CarltonFaced with the realities of the economic downturn, Midwestern sales monster Don Carlton finds himself going back to school to learn new skills and pursue a dream career in Scaring. One of Monsters University's \"mature\" students and a founding member of Oozma Kappa fraternity, Don brings his honest hardworking spirit to their endeavors ensuring that his fellow brothers keep their various heads on straight and their array of eyes on the task at hands. Art The ultimate free spirit, Art is a mysterious monster with a questionable background. By far the strangest member of the Oozma Kappas, Art bowls over the competition, sometimes literally with his unique dexterity and wild card ways. Nothing is scarier than the unpredictable, especially when it comes to this furry ball of bad. Scott \u201cSquishy\u201d SquibblesScott Squibbles gives new meaning to the term \"undeclared.\" A sophomore whose dream of becoming a Scarer was squashed in his first year at Monsters University,\"Squishy\" is a bit of a wide-eyed wanderer, small, sweet, na\u00efve and quiet who not surprisingly still lives with his doting mother. But with a little help from his Oozma Kappa brothers, Squishy begins to realize he's more than just that shy monster in the corner. Terri and Terry PerryWhen it comes to Terri and Terry, it's hard not to ask, \"Are two heads really better than one?\" These bickering brothers have little in common. Terri with an \"I\" is a real romantic who's quick to spot the silver lining in any situation, while older brother Terry with a \"y\" sports a more cynical outlook on life. If they can stop squabbling long enough to work with their Oozma Kappa brothers \u2013 they might be able to put their heads together literally and find their place in Monsters University Scare Program once and for all. Claire WheelerClaire Wheeler is the Greek Council president at Monsters University and this year she is one of the chosen emcees for the school's annual Scare Games. Don't be fooled by Claire's brooding exterior and monotone drawl, banal in appearance, on the inside she is a galvanizing force of school spirit who diligently warns the Scare Game participants of the dangers they will face. Brock Pearson This preppy-looking fraternity monster has been chosen to assist the Greek Council president in emceeing the school's annual Scare Games. Jock-like and what some might refer to as a \"meathead,\" Brock is a loud, enthusiastic emcee who relishes the danger of the Scare Games' challenges. Dean HardscrabbleTo Dean Hardscrabble, there are scary monsters and their are all other monsters. It's no surprise she feels this way, she is after all a legendary Scarer an dDean of the School of Scaring at Monsters University. Aspiring Scare students must be up for the challenge to impress her, though she is convinced that her assessment of who is truly scary and who is not is never wrong. Professor KnightProfessor Knight teaches Scaring 101, the introductory course to Scaring at Monsters University. With hundreds of new Scare students each year, Professor Knight must weed out the weak from the talented and identify who shows the most potential to be real Scarers. Only a few have what it takes to pass the formidable final exam and move on to the elite Scaring Program. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Love all things Disney.

Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl is the terrifying story of two classic monsters re-imagined as super hot \u2013 and extremely lethal \u2013 Japanese school girls. Gore rules supreme in this blood-cake cavalcade of carnage chosen as the winner of the Audience Award at the 2009 NY Asian Film Festival. Fan boys and movie blogs are already buzzing over this bloodbath du jour, and aficionados of psychedelic blood-filled chocolates, mad scientist principals, sumo wrestlers from hell, and sex-crazed school nurses are guaranteed to lose their heads over this old school splatter-fest. Amazon.com There are moments in Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl when you might find yourself idly wondering what Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley would think of all this. There's not too much time to ponder such a head-spinning proposition, however, because of all the spraying blood, teen skin cutting, and steampunk artificial limbs on display. Director Yoshihiro Nishimura, of Tokyo Gore Police notoriety, unleashes this little offering as a full-out, looney-tune romp through some of the goriest tropes of the circa-2010 Japanese horror flick. Insofar as there is a plot, it concerns a cluelessly glib vampire girl (Yukie Kawamura) who has the hots for her classmate (Takumi Saito), a boy she tries to \"turn\" by giving him a chocolate truffle filled with her own blood. (Why didn't anybody in the Twilight series think of that?) But she'll have to get past a determined rival (Eri Otoguru), whose father just happens to be a mad-scientist type looking for a test subject for his theories of reanimation. Suggesting that this qualifies as plot is something of a stretch; this movie is so spasmodically bizarre, and so slavish in putting out its cartoon-violent set pieces, that it simply barrels along according to its own demented logic. In short, those who like this kind of thing will go for it--and anybody who feels that a movie might attempt to make some feeble kind of logic, whether emotional or tonal or spatial, will be bored pretty quickly by the relentless attempts at zaniness. Various Japanese teen fads are satirized, the most startling of which is a group of school girls who try to look black--a side plot that, even though it aims at poking fun at a teen craze, uses such outrageous racial imagery that it stands out for its offensiveness in a movie that hungrily seeks to offend. --Robert Horton \n rating: 3.0 \n review: This movie disappointed me. It is nothing more than an anime type attempt using special characters to perform wages of war against mortal enemies.The gore in this movie simply was not there.

Abrams' 2009 feature film was billed as \"not your father's Star Trek ,\" but your father will probably love it anyway. And what's not to love? It has enough action, emotional impact, humor, and sheer fun for any moviegoer, and Trekkers will enjoy plenty of insider references and a cast that seems ideally suited to portray the characters we know they'll become later. Both a prequel and a reboot, Star Trek introduces us to James T. Kirk (Chris Pine of The Princess Diaries 2 ), a sharp but aimless young man who's prodded by a Starfleet captain, Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), to enlist and make a difference. At the Academy, Kirk runs afoul of a Vulcan commander named Spock (Zachary Quinto of Heroes ), but their conflict has to take a back seat when Starfleet, including its new ship, the Enterprise , has to answer an emergency call from Vulcan. What follows is a stirring tale of genocide and revenge launched by a Romulan (Eric Bana) with a particular interest in Spock, and we get to see the familiar crew come together, including McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin), and Scottie (Simon Pegg). The action and visuals make for a spectacular Big-Screen Movie, though the plot by Abrams and his writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (who worked together on Transformers and with Abrams on Alias and Mission Impossible III ), and his producers (fellow Lost ies Damon Lindeloff and Bryan Burk) can be a bit of a mind-bender (no surprise there for Lost fans). Hardcore fans with a bone to pick may find faults, but resistance is futile when you can watch Kirk take on the Kobayashi Maru scenario or hear McCoy bark, \"Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist!\" An appearance by Leonard Nimoy and hearing the late Majel Barrett Roddenberry as the voice of the computer simply sweeten the pot. Now comes the hard part: waiting for some sequels to this terrific prequel. --David Horiuchi Stills from Star Trek (Click for larger image) \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It took the old Star Trek which only reached a certain fan base and made it open to all movie-goers.<br />The cast is filled with all-star actors and the whole movie is great fun!<br /><br />As with all Blu-Ray movies, the quality is amazing and the sound is one thing that you really need Blu-Ray quality for.<br /><br />There is also a hilarious blooper reel thats good for some chuckles :D<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of Star Trek you can enjoy this movie, its action packed and has just enough comedy to make it perfect. JJ Abrams really does an amazing job with this movie and I can't wait for the sequel!-------\nItem title: Richard Hammond's Crash Course \n Item description: In this second season, Richard takes his Crash Course to a new level.

Enterprise. On a journey filled with action, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind. The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James Kirk (Chris Pine), is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock (Zachary Quinto), was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going where no one has gone before.   &amp;amp;amp;lt;!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073741899 0 0 159 0;} @font-face {font-family:Calibri; panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073750139 0 0 159 0;} @font-face {font-family:\"Book Antiqua\"; panose-1:2 4 6 2 5 3 5 3 3 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:647 0 0 0 159 0;} @font-face {font-family:Times; panose-1:2 2 6 3 5 4 5 2 3 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:536881799 -2147483648 8 0 511 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\"; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} p.MsoFooter, li.MsoFooter, div.MsoFooter {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-link:\"Footer Char\"; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; tab-stops:center 3.0in right 6.0in; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\"; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} span.FooterChar {mso-style-name:\"Footer Char\"; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-locked:yes; mso-style-link:Footer; mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\"; mso-ascii-font-family:Arial; mso-hansi-font-family:Arial;} .MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:45.35pt .75in .5in .75in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --&amp;amp;amp;gt; Amazon.com J.J. Abrams' 2009 feature film was billed as \"not your father's Star Trek ,\" but your father will probably love it anyway. And what's not to love? It has enough action, emotional impact, humor, and sheer fun for any moviegoer, and Trekkers will enjoy plenty of insider references and a cast that seems ideally suited to portray the characters we know they'll become later. Both a prequel and a reboot, Star Trek introduces us to James T. Kirk (Chris Pine of The Princess Diaries 2 ), a sharp but aimless young man who's prodded by a Starfleet captain, Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), to enlist and make a difference. At the Academy, Kirk runs afoul of a Vulcan commander named Spock (Zachary Quinto of Heroes ), but their conflict has to take a back seat when Starfleet, including its new ship, the Enterprise , has to answer an emergency call from Vulcan. What follows is a stirring tale of genocide and revenge launched by a Romulan (Eric Bana) with a particular interest in Spock, and we get to see the familiar crew come together, including McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin), and Scottie (Simon Pegg). The action and visuals make for a spectacular Big-Screen Movie, though the plot by Abrams and his writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (who worked together on Transformers and with Abrams on Alias and Mission Impossible III ), and his producers (fellow Lost ies Damon Lindeloff and Bryan Burk) can be a bit of a mind-bender (no surprise there for Lost fans). Hardcore fans with a bone to pick may find faults, but resistance is futile when you can watch Kirk take on the Kobayashi Maru scenario or hear McCoy bark, \"Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist!\" An appearance by Leonard Nimoy and hearing the late Majel Barrett Roddenberry as the voice of the computer simply sweeten the pot. Now comes the hard part: waiting for some sequels to this terrific prequel. --David Horiuchi Stills from Star Trek (Click for larger image)  rating: 5.0  review: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It took the old Star Trek which only reached a certain fan base and made it open to all movie-goers.<br />The cast is filled with all-star actors and the whole movie is great fun!<br /><br />As with all Blu-Ray movies, the quality is amazing and the sound is one thing that you really need Blu-Ray quality for.<br /><br />There is also a hilarious blooper reel thats good for some chuckles :D<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of Star Trek you can enjoy this movie, its action packed and has just enough comedy to make it perfect. JJ Abrams really does an amazing job with this movie and I can't wait for the sequel!-------Item title: Richard Hammond's Crash Course  Item description: In this second season, Richard takes his Crash Course to a new level.  He immerses himself in uniquely American and often terrifying vocations - tasked with quickly acquiring skills that are not only outside his range of expertise, but pull at the strings of some of his greatest fears.  rating: 3.0  review: I liked the first season better because it had big machines or vehicles.<br />The new season has Hammond learning various tasks all over the place (kinda like Dirty Jobs without the dirt). It's still a fun show and if you like the Hamster it's worth a watch, it provides kind of an insight into America from an outsider's point of view.-------Item title: Johnny English (Widescreen Edition)  Item description: Rowan Atkinson returns as the much-loved accidental secret agent in Johnny English Strikes Again. When a cyber-attack reveals the identity of all active undercover agents in Britain, the country's only hope is called out of retirement. English's new mission is his most critical to date: Dive headfirst into action to find the mastermind hacker. A man with few skills and analog methods, English must overcome the challenges of modern technology\u2014or his newest mission will become the Secret Service's last.

On their own and on the run, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever\u2026but Dark Forces in their midst threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile the wizarding world has become a dangerous place. The long-feared war has begun and the Dark Lord has seized control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting all who might oppose him. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort\u2026alive. Amazon.com Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is a brooding, slower-paced film than its predecessors, the result of being just one half of the final story (the last book in the series was split into two movies, released in theaters eight months apart). Because the penultimate film is all buildup before the final showdown between the teen wizard and the evil Voldemort (which does not occur until The Deathly Hallows, Part II ), Part I is a road-trip movie, a heist film, a lot of exposition, and more weight on its three young leads, who up until now were sufficiently supported by a revolving door of British thesps throughout the series. Now that all the action takes place outside Hogwarts--no more Potions classes, Gryffindor scarves, or Quidditch matches--Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron) shoulder the film almost entirely on their own. After a near-fatal ambush by Voldemort's Death Eaters, the three embark on a quest to find and destroy the remaining five horcruxes (objects that store pieces of Voldemort's soul). Fortunately, as the story gets more grave--and parents should be warned, there are some scenes too frightening or adult for young children--so does the intensity. David Yates, who directed the Harry Potter films Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince , drags the second half a little, but right along with some of the slower moments are some touching surprises (Harry leading Hermione in a dance, the return of Dobby in a totally non-annoying way). Deathly Hallows, Part I will be the most confusing for those not familiar with the Potter lore, particularly in the shorthand way characters and terminology weave in and out. For the rest of us, though, watching these characters over the last decade and saying farewell to a few faces makes it all bittersweet that the end is near (indeed, an early scene in which Hermione casts a spell that makes her Muggle parents forget her existence, in case she doesn't return, is particularly emotional). Despite its challenges, Deathly Hallows, Part I succeeds in what it's most meant to do: whet your appetite for the grand conclusion to the Harry Potter series. -- Ellen A. Kim \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Fantastic.<br />It wouldn't surprise me a bit if there were more movies to come.-------\nItem title: Lighthouses of North America [DVD] \n Item description:  \n rating: 3.0 \n review: It was good but I expected more.<br />I decided to buy the book.-------\nItem title: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 \n Item description: Product Description In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here. Amazon.com The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the film all Harry Potter fans have waited 10 years to see, and the good news is that it's worth the hype--visually stunning, action packed, faithful to the book, and mature not just in its themes and emotion but in the acting by its cast, some of whom had spent half their lives making Harry Potter movies. Part 2 cuts right to the chase: Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has stolen the Elder Wand, one of the three objects required to give someone power over death (a.k.a. the Deathly Hallows), with the intent to hunt and kill Harry. Meanwhile, Harry's quest to destroy the rest of the Horcruxes (each containing a bit of Voldemort's soul) leads him first to a thrilling (and hilarious--love that Polyjuice Potion!) trip to Gringotts Bank, then back to Hogwarts, where a spectacular battle pitting the young students and professors (a showcase of the British thesps who have stolen every scene of the series: Maggie Smith's McGonagall, Jim Broadbent's Slughorn, David Thewlis's Lupin) against a dark army of Dementors, ogres, and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter, with far less crazy eyes to make this round). As predicted all throughout the saga, Harry also has his final showdown with Voldemort--neither can live while the other survives--though the physics of that predicament might need a set of crib notes to explain. But while each installment has become progressively grimmer, this finale is the most balanced between light and dark (the dark is quite dark--several familiar characters die, with one significant death particularly grisly); the humor is sprinkled in at the most welcome times, thanks to the deft adaptation by Steve Kloves (who scribed all but one of the films from J.K. Rowling's books) and direction by four-time Potter director David Yates. The climactic kiss between Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), capping off a decade of romantic tension, is perfectly tuned to their idiosyncratic relationship, and Daniel Radcliffe has, over the last decade, certainly proven he was the right kid for the job all along. As Prof. Snape, the most perfect of casting choices in the best-cast franchise of all time, Alan Rickman breaks your heart. Only the epilogue (and the lack of chemistry between Harry and love Ginny Weasley, barely present here) stand a little shaky, but no matter: the most lucrative franchise in movie history to date has just reached its conclusion, and it's done so without losing its soul. -- Ellen A.

The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort\u2026alive. Amazon.com Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is a brooding, slower-paced film than its predecessors, the result of being just one half of the final story (the last book in the series was split into two movies, released in theaters eight months apart). Because the penultimate film is all buildup before the final showdown between the teen wizard and the evil Voldemort (which does not occur until The Deathly Hallows, Part II ), Part I is a road-trip movie, a heist film, a lot of exposition, and more weight on its three young leads, who up until now were sufficiently supported by a revolving door of British thesps throughout the series. Now that all the action takes place outside Hogwarts--no more Potions classes, Gryffindor scarves, or Quidditch matches--Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron) shoulder the film almost entirely on their own. After a near-fatal ambush by Voldemort's Death Eaters, the three embark on a quest to find and destroy the remaining five horcruxes (objects that store pieces of Voldemort's soul). Fortunately, as the story gets more grave--and parents should be warned, there are some scenes too frightening or adult for young children--so does the intensity. David Yates, who directed the Harry Potter films Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince , drags the second half a little, but right along with some of the slower moments are some touching surprises (Harry leading Hermione in a dance, the return of Dobby in a totally non-annoying way). Deathly Hallows, Part I will be the most confusing for those not familiar with the Potter lore, particularly in the shorthand way characters and terminology weave in and out. For the rest of us, though, watching these characters over the last decade and saying farewell to a few faces makes it all bittersweet that the end is near (indeed, an early scene in which Hermione casts a spell that makes her Muggle parents forget her existence, in case she doesn't return, is particularly emotional). Despite its challenges, Deathly Hallows, Part I succeeds in what it's most meant to do: whet your appetite for the grand conclusion to the Harry Potter series. -- Ellen A. Kim \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Fantastic.<br />It wouldn't surprise me a bit if there were more movies to come.-------\nItem title: Lighthouses of North America [DVD] \n Item description:  \n rating: 3.0 \n review: It was good but I expected more.<br />I decided to buy the book.-------\nItem title: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 \n Item description: Product Description In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here. Amazon.com The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the film all Harry Potter fans have waited 10 years to see, and the good news is that it's worth the hype--visually stunning, action packed, faithful to the book, and mature not just in its themes and emotion but in the acting by its cast, some of whom had spent half their lives making Harry Potter movies. Part 2 cuts right to the chase: Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has stolen the Elder Wand, one of the three objects required to give someone power over death (a.k.a. the Deathly Hallows), with the intent to hunt and kill Harry. Meanwhile, Harry's quest to destroy the rest of the Horcruxes (each containing a bit of Voldemort's soul) leads him first to a thrilling (and hilarious--love that Polyjuice Potion!) trip to Gringotts Bank, then back to Hogwarts, where a spectacular battle pitting the young students and professors (a showcase of the British thesps who have stolen every scene of the series: Maggie Smith's McGonagall, Jim Broadbent's Slughorn, David Thewlis's Lupin) against a dark army of Dementors, ogres, and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter, with far less crazy eyes to make this round). As predicted all throughout the saga, Harry also has his final showdown with Voldemort--neither can live while the other survives--though the physics of that predicament might need a set of crib notes to explain. But while each installment has become progressively grimmer, this finale is the most balanced between light and dark (the dark is quite dark--several familiar characters die, with one significant death particularly grisly); the humor is sprinkled in at the most welcome times, thanks to the deft adaptation by Steve Kloves (who scribed all but one of the films from J.K. Rowling's books) and direction by four-time Potter director David Yates. The climactic kiss between Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), capping off a decade of romantic tension, is perfectly tuned to their idiosyncratic relationship, and Daniel Radcliffe has, over the last decade, certainly proven he was the right kid for the job all along. As Prof. Snape, the most perfect of casting choices in the best-cast franchise of all time, Alan Rickman breaks your heart. Only the epilogue (and the lack of chemistry between Harry and love Ginny Weasley, barely present here) stand a little shaky, but no matter: the most lucrative franchise in movie history to date has just reached its conclusion, and it's done so without losing its soul. -- Ellen A. Kim \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Fantastic.<br />It wouldn't surprise me a bit if there were more movies to come.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy emotional biopics with powerful performances, so I'd love to watch a movie that tells a captivating story with great acting.

Marine Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Lewis) is now a U.S. congressman, and former CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Danes) has returned to civilian life. But when a new and potentially devastating terrorist threat emerges, Brody and Carrie's lives become intertwined once again and they resume their delicate dance of suspicion, deceit and desire. Delve deeper into the edge-of-your-seat excitement with the thrilling second season of this \"unmissable and gloriously suspenseful\" (USA Today) hit show. Amazon.com Homeland returns to home video with this three-disc, 12-episode set from its second season. That brings with it certain guarantees: Bombs will blow. Terrorists will terrify. Threats of global proportions will be confronted. Angst will be felt. And, oh yes, sharks will be jumped. As the season begins, the world is in turmoil, as Israel has launched several attacks against Iran. Agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes, a two-time Emmy winner in the role) isn't working for the CIA, as the events of the previous season led to an emotional breakdown, \"electroconvulsive\" therapy, and a belief that the guy who caused all of her problems, former prisoner of war-turned-hero (and Carrie's erstwhile lover) Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), is not in fact the terrorist convert she thought he was. But we know better. Indeed, Brody has managed to parlay his hero status into a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, the better to help carry out the nefarious designs of the bin Laden-esque terrorist Abu Nazir, who brainwashed Brody while he was a captive. Nazir's planning something, something big, and when an informant who might know what it is refuses to talk to anyone except Carrie, she's right back in the game, ready or not. What's more, we're only a third of the way through the season when Brody's cover is blown and he's taken into custody. That's when the real cat-and-mouse games begin. A somewhat reluctant terrorist in the first place (he backed out of a suicide bombing mission in the first season), will Brody come to his senses and help his country defeat the bad guys? Will his beleaguered wife (Morena Baccarin) and kids ever trust him again? Will he and Carrie reignite their relationship? And what of the budding romance between Brody's daughter Dana and the son of the vice president, who'd been considering naming Brody as his running mate in the next presidential election? Sure, Brody calling his wife while in the midst of murdering some poor sucker in the Pennsylvania woods, or managing to text Nazir while in a top-secret security meeting, warning the terrorist that he's about to be assassinated, are scenes that strain credulity, to put it mildly. But who cares?

Under the seasoned leadership of Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns), clients may hunt dinosaurs if they follow guidelines intended to protect the time line. But when the rules are broken, the hunters return to a markedly different future than the one they left. Now, as \"time waves\" ripple from the Prehistoric past, through the present and into an uncharted future, Ryer teams up with Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), the inventor of time travel technology, to unravel the mystery behind the catastrophic changes that are threatening the very existence of humanity. ]]> \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Sorry about the sappy headline, but this movie was adapted from one of my favorite Ray Bradbury short stories.

Then sexy superintendent Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman, Sexy Beast ) talked them into joining her Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad. Ever since, they\u2019ve been cracking cold cases, proving that old-school sleuthing skills are still the best way to solve a crime.

The main premise is not terrible but, by the time you wade through 93 minutes with the Sarah character breathing her way through acting angst, you want the movie to be over and refuse to give the film maker's any money to do it again. Run, run as fast as you can away from this movie or anyone associated with it. Read a book.-------Item title: Widow's Point  Item description: A Writer is targeted by powerful Supernatural forces when he spends a weekend in a haunted lighthouse  rating: 3.0  review: When I bought this film, I pretty much had low expectations. But I like Craig Sheffer, and I was curious about the film. Craig Sheffer was very good. That was worth three stars. The director  was terrible. The sound man has been deaf for years. The child actor had her moments, but every other actor in the movie should not have been. Some people seem to want to let Richard Chizmar off the hook as the writer, but he was the executive producer and he let everyone else get away with absolutely their worst efforts. I don't feel bad for what paid for this film. One day I'll meet Chizmar and have a good laugh. Maybe I'll have him sign it.-------Item title: Halloween Kills - Extended Cut Blu-ray + DVD + Digital  Item description: The Halloween night when Michael Myers returned isn't over yet.

The vigilante mob then sets out to hunt Michael down, once and for all. Evil dies tonight.  rating: 1.0  review: Michael Meyers meets the purge.<br />Guess who wins !<br />  Don't buy it, don't watch it.<br />See what happens to Jamie Lee Curtis' and Anthony Michael hall's career.<br />  Oh, so sad.-------Item title: Purple Rain Deluxe  Item description: Purple Rain remains one of history\u2019s most important, indisputable, and influential albums, but you\u2019ve never heard it like this before.

I've never missed a book and I've never been disappointed for even a moment. For some strange reason I've always loved ants. Mister Wilson has allowed me to look through his eyes with the same sense of wonder I did as a child. Many thanks to Edward O Wilson and thank you for the video.

But when the rules are broken, the hunters return to a markedly different future than the one they left. Now, as \"time waves\" ripple from the Prehistoric past, through the present and into an uncharted future, Ryer teams up with Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), the inventor of time travel technology, to unravel the mystery behind the catastrophic changes that are threatening the very existence of humanity. ]]>  rating: 5.0  review: Sorry about the sappy headline, but this movie was adapted from one of my favorite Ray Bradbury short stories. I've read the story, read the comic book, seen the movie and I still find myself overwhelmed by the thought provoking premise. If you didn't take a humanity elective in college, watch this movie ...butterflies will thank you for it and so will you.-------Item title: New Tricks: Season 8  Item description: THIS SERIES IS THE UN-EDITED, UK BROADCAST VERSION \"Well written and well acted\"- Library Journal \"Amusing, off-kilter stories\"- Deseret (UT) News As seen on PBS  \"Wonderful performances from terrific TV actors\" - Daily Mirror (U.K.)  Retired cops solve cold cases in this hit British series  Detectives Jack Halford (James Bolam, The Beiderbecke Affair ), Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong, Garrow\u2019s Law ), and Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman, The Sweeney ) retired years ago.

Night Shyamalan (Oscar(R)-nominee for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director) that critics are calling one of the greatest ghost stories ever filmed. When Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis), a distinguished child psychologist, meets Cole Sear (Oscar(R)-nominee Haley Joel Osment, Best Supporting Actor), a frightened, confused, eight-year-old, Dr. Crowe is completely unprepared to face the truth of what haunts Cole. With a riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling, the discovery of Cole's incredible sixth sense leads them to mysterious places with unforgettable consequences! Amazon.com \"I see dead people,\" whispers little Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), scared to affirm what is to him now a daily occurrence. This peaked 9-year old, already hypersensitive to begin with, is now being haunted by seemingly malevolent spirits. Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to find out what's triggering Cole's visions, but what appears to be a psychological manifestation turns out to be frighteningly real. It might be enough to scare off a lesser man, but for Malcolm it's personal--several months before, he was accosted and shot by an unhinged patient, who then turned the gun on himself. Since then, Malcolm has been in turmoil--he and his wife (Olivia Williams) are barely speaking, and his life has taken an aimless turn. Having failed his loved ones and himself, he's not about to give up on Cole. This third feature by M. Night Shyamalan sets itself up as a thriller, poised on the brink of delivering monstrous scares, but gradually evolves into more of a psychological drama with supernatural undertones. Many critics faulted the film for being mawkish and New Age-y, but no matter how you slice it, this is one mightily effective piece of filmmaking. The bare bones of the story are basic enough, but the moody atmosphere created by Shyamalan and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto made this one of the creepiest pictures of 1999, forsaking excessive gore for a sinisterly simple feeling of chilly otherworldliness. Willis is in his strong, silent type mode here, and gives the film wholly over to Osment, whose crumpled face and big eyes convey a child too wise for his years; his scenes with his mother (Toni Collette) are small, heartbreaking marvels. And even if you figure out the film's surprise ending, it packs an amazingly emotional wallop when it comes, and will have you racing to watch the movie again with a new perspective. You may be able to shake off the sentimentality of The Sixth Sense , but its craftsmanship and atmosphere will stay with you for days. --Mark Englehart \n rating: 5.0 \n review: first of all, anyone with any common sense knows not to watch the extra stuff before you see the movie. therefore, it should go without saying that the added material does give away the twist.  the ending does lose its  surprise after the first viewing, but you notice so much more each time you  see it afterwards.  i went to see it at the theatre opening weekend, and i  am glad i didn't wait.  too many people gave away the ending, and i'll  admit that it was hard not to tell people the end when i was telling about  it.  Haley Joel Osment is awesome; i hope he continues to find scripts that  are a challenge for him. there are a lot of really neat camera angles and  such that you wouldn'y normally think about using.  if you are looking for  a blood and guts horror movie, don't see this, because that's not what it  is.  rather, it deals more with psychological issues and pulls in your  emotions, rather than your fear.  i too am somwhat annoyed that the DVD  makes you watch the previews, but i think i can deal with it.  it certainly  isn't going to stop me from watching it again.  like Thomas Crown Affair,  the ending does surpirse you, and is a big part of the movie's appeal, but  t shouldn't keep you from multiple viewings.  overall, i think this is a  great movie, and it has been added to my family's list of favorites.-------\nItem title: She's All That \n Item description: An irresistible cast of Hollywood's young faces star in this fun, sexy comedy hit about the power of attraction and the pressures of popularity!

Rachael Leigh Cook is so beautiful,  that the transformation takes very little to work.  Freddie Prinze, Jr.  smashes all your ideas about how jocks are, and plays them how they should  be.

The chemistry between heath and julia is great.  the movie is a standout among all the high school prom movies that came out last spring.  heath ledger is almost too cute to play the alterna-bad boy stereotype, but  it works for him.  one of my favorite parts was when he sang on the  bleachers.  it's the way high school romances should be-always sweet and  puts a smile on your face when you think about it.-------\nItem title: Never Been Kissed \n Item description: Never Been Kissed \n rating: 4.0 \n review: i also disagree with the official review.  i have seen this movie two or three times, and i get a happy feeling every time i see it.  everyone struggles in high school, and who doesn't wish sometimes that they could go  back and be part of the popular crowd?  while some of the parts are a bit  cliche, overall, the movie leaves you hoping that your high school reunions  will only do as well in uniting you with that group.-------\nItem title: Deep Blue Sea \n Item description: Product description Searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease a group of scientists on an isolated research facility become the bait as a trio of intelligent sharks fight back. Genre: Feature Film-Action/Adventure Rating: R Release Date: 3-FEB-2004 Media Type: DVD Amazon.com With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc, Deep Blue Sea dares to up the ante on Jaws , but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned. Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses the worst time for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL Cool J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and as a series of action set-pieces, Deep Blue Sea never disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver in Alien , but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; that Deep Blue Sea can be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 2.0 \n review: My mother and i watched this movie last night.  From all the reviews, i thought it would be interesting, and a halfway decent action movie.  umm...no.  the computer effects of the sharks are halfway decent, but the  computer-generated people look more like bad video game character  characters than people.  the characters had almost no depth to them, making  me not care whether they lived or died.  we watched the deleted scenes at  the end of the dvd, and if they had been left in, the characters might have  actually had an impact, rather than just be shark food.  the director, in  his commentary, kept saying that they took things out to keep the pace up.  i would rather have learned a little more about the characters.  however, i  did think ll cool j was very good, and he made it funny.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, I'm in the mood for a classic romance film with great music and a captivating story, so recommend me something that fits that description.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Night Shyamalan (Oscar(R)-nominee for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director) that critics are calling one of the greatest ghost stories ever filmed. When Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis), a distinguished child psychologist, meets Cole Sear (Oscar(R)-nominee Haley Joel Osment, Best Supporting Actor), a frightened, confused, eight-year-old, Dr. Crowe is completely unprepared to face the truth of what haunts Cole. With a riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling, the discovery of Cole's incredible sixth sense leads them to mysterious places with unforgettable consequences! Amazon.com \"I see dead people,\" whispers little Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), scared to affirm what is to him now a daily occurrence. This peaked 9-year old, already hypersensitive to begin with, is now being haunted by seemingly malevolent spirits. Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to find out what's triggering Cole's visions, but what appears to be a psychological manifestation turns out to be frighteningly real. It might be enough to scare off a lesser man, but for Malcolm it's personal--several months before, he was accosted and shot by an unhinged patient, who then turned the gun on himself. Since then, Malcolm has been in turmoil--he and his wife (Olivia Williams) are barely speaking, and his life has taken an aimless turn. Having failed his loved ones and himself, he's not about to give up on Cole. This third feature by M. Night Shyamalan sets itself up as a thriller, poised on the brink of delivering monstrous scares, but gradually evolves into more of a psychological drama with supernatural undertones. Many critics faulted the film for being mawkish and New Age-y, but no matter how you slice it, this is one mightily effective piece of filmmaking. The bare bones of the story are basic enough, but the moody atmosphere created by Shyamalan and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto made this one of the creepiest pictures of 1999, forsaking excessive gore for a sinisterly simple feeling of chilly otherworldliness. Willis is in his strong, silent type mode here, and gives the film wholly over to Osment, whose crumpled face and big eyes convey a child too wise for his years; his scenes with his mother (Toni Collette) are small, heartbreaking marvels. And even if you figure out the film's surprise ending, it packs an amazingly emotional wallop when it comes, and will have you racing to watch the movie again with a new perspective. You may be able to shake off the sentimentality of The Sixth Sense , but its craftsmanship and atmosphere will stay with you for days. --Mark Englehart \n rating: 5.0 \n review: first of all, anyone with any common sense knows not to watch the extra stuff before you see the movie. therefore, it should go without saying that the added material does give away the twist.  the ending does lose its  surprise after the first viewing, but you notice so much more each time you  see it afterwards.  i went to see it at the theatre opening weekend, and i  am glad i didn't wait.  too many people gave away the ending, and i'll  admit that it was hard not to tell people the end when i was telling about  it.

Amazon.com One of the finest films ever made about the American Civil War, Glory also has the honor of being the first major Hollywood film to acknowledge the vital contribution of African American soldiers to the country's historic struggle. Based on the books Lay This Laurel , by Lincoln Kirstein, and One Gallant Rush , by Peter Burchard, and the wartime letters of Robert Gould Shaw, the film tells the story of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, an all-black unit comprising Northern freemen and escaped slaves. Under the command of Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick), the 54th served admirably in battle until they made their ultimate demonstration of bravery during the almost suicidal assault on the Confederate Fort Wagner in Charleston, South Carolina, on July 18, 1863. Glory achieves its powerful impact by meticulously setting up the terrible conditions under which these neglected soldiers fought, and by illuminating the tenacity of the human spirit from the oppression of slavery to the hard-won recognition of battlefield heroism. Although Denzel Washington deservedly won an Oscar for his supporting role as a runaway-slave-turned-soldier, Glory faced some tough competition at the 1989 Academy Awards (against popular hits like Driving Miss Daisy and Dead Poets Society ) and was shut out of nearly all the major categories.

But little by little, through stories spun against a backdrop of the dusty Texas night, an amazing tale comes to life via Walter's vivid, colorful imaginings--a tale set in a long-ago exotic, mysterious place where men rode stallions and fought with swords; where beautiful princesses tangled with treacherous sheiks; and where the two unlikely heroes lived an adventure of which most people only dream. ]]>  rating: 5.0  review: This is a great film; one of my favorites!-------Item title: Victory at Sea: The Complete Series  Item description: Product Description The Complete 26 Episode Series PLUS 6 BONUS War Documentary Programs An Emmy and Peabody award winning, TV series chronicling naval warfare during WWII.

This radiant adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s treasured novel is from the award-winning team behind the BBC\u2019s hit Pride and Prejudice . Kate Beckinsale ( Pearl Harbor , Underworld ) is Emma, a well-bred young lady who spends her time arranging what she sees as suitable matches. When she befriends Harriet Smith (Samantha Morton, In America ), she sees the timid young woman as the perfect beneficiary of her efforts. But the matchmaking sets off a chain of misunderstandings and mix-ups that challenges Emma\u2019s assumptions and draws her own heart into the fray.  Austen\u2019s sharply drawn characters spring to life against the background of the glorious English countryside in this Emmy\u00ae-winning production that also stars Mark Strong ( Sherlock Holmes ), Samantha Bond ( Downton Abbey ), and Prunella Scales ( Mapp & Lucia ). \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Well done!-------\nItem title: Frozen \n Item description: Product Description Fearless optimist Anna teams up with Kristoff in an epic journey, encountering Everest-like conditions, and a hilarious snowman named Olaf in a race to find Anna's sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. Amazon.com A sweet, magical film filled with great music, likable characters, and striking effects, Frozen is a fairy tale about overcoming obstacles and the power of true love. Princesses Anna and Elsa are sisters and the closest friends until one day Elsa discovers that she can no longer control her power to create ice and snow. Terrified for the safety of her sister and everyone around her, Elsa isolates herself and vows to never feel any sort of passionate emotion again in hopes of suppressing her powers. But when Elsa comes of age and is set to be crowned queen, she must open the gates of the palace and let in the public, not to mention her sister Anna. Things go horribly wrong and Anna pursues her sister into the mountains in an attempt to save Elsa and reverse the deep freeze that Elsa has inadvertently released on the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, Anna joins forces with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), an ice seller with a strangely close relationship with his reindeer Sven, and Olaf (Josh Gad), a goofy snowman whom she suddenly remembers from early childhood. In the end, Anna and Elsa discover that only by embracing their deepest feelings do they have a chance of saving themselves and the kingdom. Inspired by \"The Snow Queen\" story by Hans Christian Andersen, the film has plenty of quirky, lovable characters along with a nice blend of corny humor, serious sentiment, suspense, and peril. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel deliver rousing performances of great music that includes original songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez and an original score by Christophe Beck, and the visual effects are simply stunning. Frozen definitely succeeds in captivating audiences young, old, and every age in between. --Tami Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: What's not to love????-------\nItem title: Uncle Tom's Cabin \n Item description: Uncle Tom's Cabin [VHS] [VHStape] [1997] \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Received as described-------\nItem title: Jane Austen: The Complete Collection (DVD) \n Item description: Jane Austen: The Complete Collection (Repackaged/DVD) Lovingly remastered BBC original productions of six of Jane Austen's finest novels - Sense & Sensibility, Emma, Mansfield Park, Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey .

This set collects the newly remastered titles below, plus the previously issued the Sound of Music, State Fair, and Oklahoma. All are 2-DVD special editions. Amazon.com The Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection contains film versions of the five major works by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, who helped define the American musical landscape and rewrite the direction of musical theater. After enjoying extremely successful careers working with others, Rodgers and Hammerstein first teamed up in 1943 for the prairie tale Oklahoma! , with songs including \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" and \"People Will Say We're in Love.\" The subsequent 1955 film starred Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, who teamed up again for 1956's Carousel . While that film's dark nature made it less popular than its predecessor, the score (\"If I Loved You,\" \"You'll Never Walk Alone\") was Rodgers's favorite. The King and I (also 1956) featured stage star Yul Brynner as the King of Siam and Deborah Kerr as schoolteacher Anna Leonowens, who must learn Asian customs even as she tries to instill some of her Western ones. The somewhat bloated version of South Pacific (1958) follows two couples during World War II and features standards such as \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair\" and \"Some Enchanted Evening\" from stars Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi. The last film, The Sound of Music (1965), proved to be the most popular, with Julie Andrews winning the hearts of seven children and their father with her blissful songs. And if the perhaps saccharine music and plot may test the patience of some, there's no doubt that songs such as \"My Favorite Things\" and \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" have charmed audiences around the world for decades. Accompanying the Big 5 in this set is the relatively minor State Fair from 1945 (though it does have \"It Might as Well Be Spring\" and \"It's a Grand Night for Singing\"). Some may expect and prefer other entries in the R&H canon such as Flower Drum Song or the television production Cinderella , but those were produced by different studios. This 12-disc set from 2006 includes the two-disc special editions of each film, remastered and anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs (except State Fair , which was shot in traditional 1.33:1 aspect ratio). Bonus features include the Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! (which should look better than the CinemaScope version but doesn't); 40th-anniversary bonus material for The Sound of Music , including a commentary track by Julie Andrews; Lilliom , the 1934 film based on the same story as Carousel ; and the 1962 version of State Fair starring Pat Boone and Ann-Margaret. --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: There are remakes to some but nothing stands up like the classics.

        "ground_truth": "Title: The Unsinkable Molly Brown \n Description: \"Be sure the story is something you cannot resist,\" Richard Rodgers once advised Meredith Willson. After considering 100 projects for a successor to The Music Man, Willson found one that was irresistible. And unsinkable. Debbie Reynolds plays the title role, inviting all to Belly Up to the Bar, Boys for the whoop-and-holler film of Willson's 1960 Broadway hit. Reynolds won a 1964 Best Actress Oscar nomination as the backwoods heroine who survives the Titanic and the snobbery of Denver society. Screen-debuting Harve Presnell reprises his stage role of Johnny, who has heartful-and-a-half of love for Molly. Johnny wasn't alone. Astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young so admired the movie they named their Gemini 3 spacecraft Molly Brown.
