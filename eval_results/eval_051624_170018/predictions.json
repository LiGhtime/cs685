The contestants are marooned 20 miles off the coast of Borneo and forced to fend for themselves in hopes of outlasting the others in the group which meets every 3 days to vote one person off the island and the show. 1999-2000/color/11 hrs, 4 min/NR/fullscreen. Amazon.com Here's where it all began. The first season of Survivor dominated the ratings in the summer of 2000, helped spur the reality-TV craze, and inspired countless water-cooler jokes about getting voted off the island. The first season established the formula that would continue, with sometimes surprising variations, over numerous subsequent seasons: 16 people intended to represent the American mosaic are stranded far from civilization (in this case, the island of Pulau Tiga, off the coast of Borneo), struggle for food and shelter, compete in a series of physical and mental challenges, and at the end of each three-day episode vote out one of their fellow contestants. After 39 days, the one sole survivor who is able to outwit, outplay, and outlast the others wins a million-dollar prize. Because the Survivor craze preceded the craze for complete-season DVD boxed sets, the first season was represented on DVD and video by a 150-minute highlights package called Season One: The Greatest and Most Outrageous Moments . Now, all 13 episodes are available in a five-disc set (the fifth disc is ...Outrageous Moments ) that contains every challenge, every political maneuver, every next-episode preview and previous-episode recap, every tribal council including the famous finale, and the reunion show. If you started watching Survivor in the Australian Outback or later, this is the perfect opportunity to see how host Jeff Probst, scheming Richard Hatch, tough truck driver Sue Hawk, ex-Navy SEAL Rudy Boesch, athletic Kelly Wiglesworth, and the others got the ball rolling. If you did watch the first season, here's your chance to relive it, and you also get an enthusiastic group commentary by host Jeff Probst (poking fun at himself) and contestants Hatch (talking the most, which should surprise no one), Boesch, and Gervase Peterson on the first and last episodes, plus some minor featurettes (seven minutes of footage of the contestants leaving L.A. for Borneo, David Letterman's Top 10 featuring the contestants, and 10 minutes of new interviews with Hatch, Boesch, and Peterson). Many reality shows have come and gone in the meantime, but in terms of staying fresh over a long run, Survivor has outwitted, outplayed, and outlasted them all. --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Good to go back to the origins occasionally-------\nItem title: Survivor - The Australian Outback: Season 2 \n Item description: Product Description Tina, Colby, Jerri, Elizabeth..they're all here in the second season of this popular reality TV series. Amazon.com Survivor: The Australian Outback , the second season of the reality-show titan, remains the best season in the series' history. But assuming most people already know who won the million-dollar prize, is there still any appeal to watching on DVD? Yep, because first, the cast was exceptional, claiming no fewer than five of the 18 participants in Survivor All Stars and a few others who could have been. The group included Texas powerhouse Colby Donaldson, villainess-bartender-\"aspiring actress\" Jerri Manthey; tough Michael Skupin; Keith Famie, the chef who couldn't make rice; buff personal trainer Alicia Calaway; sweet Elisabeth Filarski (who as Elisabeth Hasselbeck later became a TV personality on The View ) and her protector Rodger Bingham; mom Tina Wesson; savvy Jeff Varner; and pretty Amber Brkich. Second, the show was still new and the Australian Outback has an appealing freshness when compared to so many subsequent seasons in which the competitors are continually trying to game the system. The challenges are still exciting to watch (though they might seem relatively tame). There was also the beef-jerky incident, the Colby-Jerri dynamic, Rodger's cliff jump, and the domination of the Kucha tribe before the game turned. You might have forgotten many of these developments over the years, though the season was represented on home video by the 2000 highlights compilation The Greatest and Most Outrageous Moments (also included in this set for completists), which now feels a lot like the dreary recap episode that drags down almost every season. The bonus features are pretty good as well. Colby again proves he's top dog by recording commentary for two episodes with host Jeff Probst (who calls the Texan \"one of my closest friends\"). A more titillating combination is the commentary by Kimmi Kappenberg, Alicia, and Michael for two episodes, including the famous finger-wagging incident and Michael's misfortune. Keith, Rodger, Tina, and Amber also pitch in on commentary for two episodes, and all nine of the above contributors are interviewed for the half-hour of featurettes. (Jerri and Elisabeth are the most notable absences.) Unlike some Survivor DVD featurettes, these are all Outback -specific, offering insight into luxury items, real dangers, and eating, and Keith gets an opportunity to redeem himself by demonstrating how to prepare a dish of paella. The real appeal of the set, however, is watching the episodes again and remembering why Survivor: The Australian Outback remains the standard against which all subsequent seasons are judged. --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Good to go back to the origins occasionally-------\nItem title: Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: Complete Series \n Item description: Limited edition set contains all 41 episodes of the 3 season television series. Hanna- Barbera series featuring Scooby Doo, a dog who joins Velma, Daphne, Freddie, and Shaggy on many quests to solve mysterious. Each mystery is new and unusual and involves the group stopping someone from wreaking certain havoc on the world. Scooby-Doo was a large, loveable but cowardly Great Dane who hung around four California high school students (Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy). The four teen-agers were in constant search of mysteries and adventures, driving around in a bright green van known as the Mystery Machine. Many of the group's adventures involved villians who took on supernatural disguises (ghosts and monsters); the villians' activities usually involved blackmail, theft, fraud and other forms of corruption. At the first hint of trouble, Scooby-Doo (and usually, Shaggy as well) running for cover; they usually found themselves in even deeper trouble. It usually took the promise of a Scooby snack to get Scooby (and Shaggy) to come out of hiding. The mysteries were always solved by the end of each show. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Brought back Saturday mornings from my childhood.-------\nItem title: Range 15 \n Item description: A group of veterans find that the zombie apocalypse has spread across the United States.

Fittingly, this season's 20 castaways are divided into two tribes by age, with 30 years old and younger on La Flor and 40 years old and older on Espada. That makes this season youth vs. experience that includes legendary coach, Jimmy Johnson. These tribes show age is just a number when shoes are stolen at Espada while socks are stolen at La Flor. With tempers flaring, the young castaways struggle to overcome some potentially dangerous personality conflicts. A battle erupts when one castaway pushes her tribemate who has a prosthetic leg to gain a clue to the hidden immunity idol. For the first time, these clues are given with pictures, not words. A surprise tribal swap ends the generation gap, as newly formed tribes find some making new allies and others losing theirs. Emotions run high as the elements and the reality of the game set in. With alliances and determination put to the test, some question their place in the game. Find out each castaway's fate and watch as they battle it out of the chance to be crowned sole survivor and win the million dollar prize on DVD.

The pair\u2019s out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University\u2019s elite Scare Program.

Get ready to party with hours of exclusive bonus extras, including an inside look at the world of monsters and the animated theatrical short film \"The Blue Umbrella.\" Amazon.com Mike WazowskiMike Wazowski's lifelong dream is to become a Scarer at Monsters, Inc. and he's sure he knows just how to do it. Ever since he was a young monster, Mike's had his eye on Monsters University, home of the world's top Scare Program. Now a freshman and hopeful Scare student, he's well versed in the rich history, theory, and technique required to reach his goal, and the little green one-eyed monster has more confidence, enthusiasm, determination and heart than all of his classmates combined. But unexpected roadblocks derail Mike's plans and he's forced to team up with a group of misfit monsters and an unlikely ally to give it the old college try and pull off the biggest coup in the University's history. James P SullivanWhen it comes to Scaring, Sulley's a natural, his abundant size, fierce roar and family legacy of a long line of high-achieving Scarers make him a shoo-in for the esteemed Scare Program at Monsters University. But from the moment the overly confident monster steps his big furry feet on campus, it's clear he'd rather crack jokes than books and he learns the hard way that his unfettered talent and family ties can only get him so far. With his ego bruised and future in jeopardy, a stubborn Sulley must put his pride aside, team up with an odd bunch of misfit monsters and actually work if he wants to live up to his true Scaring potential. Randy BoggsMonsters University freshman Randy Boggs has big aspirations for college life. The peculiar lizard-like monster with his host of gangly arms and legs plans to major in Scaring and lead an active social life filled with fun, friends and fraternity parties. If only he could get his embarrassing disappearing habit under control, he'd be good to go, because how is he ever going to be a great Scarer if nobody can see him? Don CarltonFaced with the realities of the economic downturn, Midwestern sales monster Don Carlton finds himself going back to school to learn new skills and pursue a dream career in Scaring. One of Monsters University's \"mature\" students and a founding member of Oozma Kappa fraternity, Don brings his honest hardworking spirit to their endeavors ensuring that his fellow brothers keep their various heads on straight and their array of eyes on the task at hands. Art The ultimate free spirit, Art is a mysterious monster with a questionable background. By far the strangest member of the Oozma Kappas, Art bowls over the competition, sometimes literally with his unique dexterity and wild card ways.

Scott \u201cSquishy\u201d SquibblesScott Squibbles gives new meaning to the term \"undeclared.\" A sophomore whose dream of becoming a Scarer was squashed in his first year at Monsters University,\"Squishy\" is a bit of a wide-eyed wanderer, small, sweet, na\u00efve and quiet who not surprisingly still lives with his doting mother.

Terri and Terry PerryWhen it comes to Terri and Terry, it's hard not to ask, \"Are two heads really better than one?\" These bickering brothers have little in common. Terri with an \"I\" is a real romantic who's quick to spot the silver lining in any situation, while older brother Terry with a \"y\" sports a more cynical outlook on life. If they can stop squabbling long enough to work with their Oozma Kappa brothers \u2013 they might be able to put their heads together literally and find their place in Monsters University Scare Program once and for all. Claire WheelerClaire Wheeler is the Greek Council president at Monsters University and this year she is one of the chosen emcees for the school's annual Scare Games. Don't be fooled by Claire's brooding exterior and monotone drawl, banal in appearance, on the inside she is a galvanizing force of school spirit who diligently warns the Scare Game participants of the dangers they will face. Brock Pearson This preppy-looking fraternity monster has been chosen to assist the Greek Council president in emceeing the school's annual Scare Games. Jock-like and what some might refer to as a \"meathead,\" Brock is a loud, enthusiastic emcee who relishes the danger of the Scare Games' challenges. Dean HardscrabbleTo Dean Hardscrabble, there are scary monsters and their are all other monsters. It's no surprise she feels this way, she is after all a legendary Scarer an dDean of the School of Scaring at Monsters University. Aspiring Scare students must be up for the challenge to impress her, though she is convinced that her assessment of who is truly scary and who is not is never wrong. Professor KnightProfessor Knight teaches Scaring 101, the introductory course to Scaring at Monsters University. With hundreds of new Scare students each year, Professor Knight must weed out the weak from the talented and identify who shows the most potential to be real Scarers.

Pretty stupid :(-------\nItem title: Wall-E (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo) \n Item description: Product Description The highly acclaimed director of Finding Nemo and the creative storytellers behind Cars and Ratatouille transport you to a galaxy not so far away for a new cosmic comedy adventure about a determined robot named Wall-E . Experience the exciting animated hit film with theater-quality sound and the most pristine picture available on Disney Blu-ray Disc. After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, the curious and lovable Wall-E discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named Eve. Join them and a hilarious cast of characters on a fantastic journey across the universe. Transport yourself to a fascinating new world with Disney-Pixar's latest adventure -- unsurpassed on Blu-ray Hi-Def. Loaded with bonus features, including the animated short \"Burn-E,\" this 3-disc set overflows with fun for the entire family. Amazon.com Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race. Wall-E is preceded in theaters by the comical short Presto in which a magician's rabbit, unfed one too many times takes his revenge against the egotistical magician.

It's no surprise she feels this way, she is after all a legendary Scarer an dDean of the School of Scaring at Monsters University. Aspiring Scare students must be up for the challenge to impress her, though she is convinced that her assessment of who is truly scary and who is not is never wrong.

As it turns out, Minions have existed since the beginning of time. They have evolved from single (yellow) cell organisms into the familiar beings we know, and they live for a collective purpose: to seek out and serve the most despicable master they can find. Academy Award winner Sandra Bullock will lead the voice cast of the human characters as Scarlett Overkill, the world's reigning super-villain of the 1960s. \n rating: 1.0 \n review: Not a fan.  Pretty stupid :(-------\nItem title: Wall-E (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo) \n Item description: Product Description The highly acclaimed director of Finding Nemo and the creative storytellers behind Cars and Ratatouille transport you to a galaxy not so far away for a new cosmic comedy adventure about a determined robot named Wall-E . Experience the exciting animated hit film with theater-quality sound and the most pristine picture available on Disney Blu-ray Disc. After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, the curious and lovable Wall-E discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named Eve. Join them and a hilarious cast of characters on a fantastic journey across the universe. Transport yourself to a fascinating new world with Disney-Pixar's latest adventure -- unsurpassed on Blu-ray Hi-Def. Loaded with bonus features, including the animated short \"Burn-E,\" this 3-disc set overflows with fun for the entire family. Amazon.com Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race. Wall-E is preceded in theaters by the comical short Presto in which a magician's rabbit, unfed one too many times takes his revenge against the egotistical magician.

After appearing on numerous television shows and films during his youth, the Emmy Award-nominated actor delivered a performance for the ages in the beloved holiday film, A Christmas Story (1983). Melinda Dillon made her feature-film debut as an eccentric neighbor of Catherine Deneuve's in The April Fools (1969) and in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Her warmth fostered two mother roles in the whimsical comedies A Christmas Story (1983) and Harry and the Hendersons (1987). About the Director Bob Clark is a director known for his '80s movies such as A Christmas Story (1983), Porky's (1982) and Rhinestone (1984).

It just so happened that &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; was the first thing to catch my eye, so &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; it was.

It was a choice well made.<br />&quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is one of those movies that can take place anywhere, any time and with any slew of characters. It's simple. I guess that's why I like it. The appealingness of it all isn't really the fact that it was psycologically stimulating but that you can relate to each and every one of the characters.

I suppose that's the only way to describe &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;...Real.<br />I found the lack of special effects and expensive stuff made the movie better. You focused more on the lines and the plot, rather than the great car and two billion dollar explosion that just errupted.

With an absorbing story line, cute understated humor and marvelous sets, you begin to forget that you are actually getting a history lesson. Derick Jacobi as well as the entire cast preform superbly. I really found that it was kind of like an indie film...simple, smart and cerebral.<br />One thing that really struck my attention was the fantastic job done on aging make-up. It's really not that important or anything, but it sure does make the story seem so much more realistic.

The whole thing. One person may watch it for the costumes, another for the set pieces and back drops, and some may just watch it to be entertained. It dosen't matter if you don't know diddily squat about ancient Rome, I, Claudius will set the record straight.

Young Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) is approached by an elderly woman who gives him an antique gold watch and who pleads with him to return in time with her. Years later, Richard Collier is overwhelmed by a photograph of a beautiful young woman (Jane Seymour). Another picture of this woman in her later years reveals to him that she is the same woman who had given him the gold watch. Collier then becomes obsessed with returning to 1912 and the beautiful young woman who awaits him there. Set Contains: For devoted fans of Somewhere in Time , the exclusive documentary on this DVD will provide welcomed insight, background history, and poignant validation. The film was virtually saved from oblivion by a combination of cable TV exposure and grassroots fandom, and this engrossing documentary benefits from the participation of the film's principal cast and crew, all of whom remain as fond of this production as its legion of fans. Taped in 2000, the interviews are highlighted by the perspective of Christopher Reeve, whose fond recollections gain a certain profundity when combined with the physical impact of his paralyzing injury in 1995. But Reeve (who compares his near-death experience in the film with one he actually had after his injury) isn't the only one whose life had been touched by the magic of this film-that-wouldn't-die: from director Jeannot Szwarc to Jane Seymour and all others involved, Somewhere in Time was clearly a special experience, and their pride and pleasure are sweetly conveyed in this enjoyable hour-long tribute. Additionally, the DVD gives due credit to the fan club INSITE--the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts--in a featurette exploring the club's history and membership. The INSITE's mailing and Web site addresses are also provided. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is a favorite movie of ours.  We wanted the DVD since VCR's are obsolete.

A young man discovers a letter written by a mysterious woman named Lizzie, who lived long ago, and feels compelled to write to her. Correspondence ensues and grows into a love so powerful not even the years can keep them apart. Spanning the Civil War to the present, the perils of Lizzie's war-torn situation threaten her safe passage into the future. Will their love endure the test of time? Amazon.com No one with romantic tendencies will be able to resist The Love Letter . Campbell Scott plays a Civil War buff who buys a desk from that era. While polishing it, he discovers a secret compartment, in which sits an unmailed letter--a letter written by a young woman named Lizzie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) over a century earlier. Touched by her yearning for passion, he writes her back, egged on by his mystically inclined mother (Estelle Parsons). Magically his letter reaches Lizzie and they begin a correspondence that threatens Scott's impending marriage but promises to bring fulfilment to Lizzie. The Love Letter is absurd, yet somehow that doesn't stop it from being completely engaging and even moving. Scott and Parsons are solid, while Jason Leigh is downright rapturous--the movie may owe its success to her. The plot has surprising twists and the conclusion is sweet and satisfying.

But for the Halliwell sisters, this has become their destiny. Prue, the oldest, is driven to succeed and dislikes the free-spirited antics of the youngest sister Phoebe. Piper, the earthy middle sister, mediates between her siblings. Phoebe discovers The Book of Shadows in the attic and their witchly powers are activated, igniting a bond that reaches beyond petty, sisterly grudges. Prue has the power to move objects, Piper to freeze time and Phoebe to see the future. The sisters must band together to protect themselves, and the world, from the dark, demonic forces that seek to destroy them. It's an existence fraught with excitement and danger, but these three unique sisters wouldn't trade their \"charmed\" lives for anything. Amazon.com Charmed: The Complete Third Season is a little different from its previous seasons in that the long-running series, for the first time, is dominated by a single story arc that affects nearly every episode. Actor Julian McMahon ( Nip/Tuck , Fantastic Four ) joins the Charmed cast as Assistant District Attorney Cole Turner, who enters the show when he unsuccessfully prosecutes a demon-possessed killer who attacks the Halliwell sisters' police ally, Inspector Morris (Dorian Gregory). In short order, Cole becomes romantically involved with Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), but it's soon revealed that he's actually a demon, part of an unholy plot to destroy the Charmed Ones, i.e. the Halliwell sisters. Trouble is, Cole's human incarnation begins to battle with his demon self, and the rest of the season is really dedicated to the ramifications of his ambivalence. Even old issues on Charmed , such as the forbidden love of Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Leo (Brian Krause), an angelic Whitelighter, become secondary to the Cole-Phoebe story. (The latter becomes supernatural when Phoebe's misery over Cole turns her into a shrieking Banshee and the pair meet up in the hellish Dark Side.) Season highlights include \"Primrose Empath,\" in which Shannen Doherty gives a superb performance when her character, Prue Halliwell, takes on the powers of an empath and is soon overwhelmed by the emotional pain carried by scores of others. \"Sleuthing with the Enemy\" finds Prue and Piper, in the first of several such stories, working at opposite purposes from Phoebe, who is intent on saving Cole from capture or destruction. The clever and comic \"Look Who's Barking\" concerns a spell that turns Prue into a Banshee-tracking dog who gets hit by a car and briefly becomes the pet of a handsome, single man. Season finale \"All Hell Breaks Loose\" may be the best Charmed episode in its first three years, a scary and apocalyptic tale in which the powers of the Halliwell sisters, long kept secret, are revealed to an insatiable news media, the police and military, and dangerous crazies. Not to be missed. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Unfortunately, I didn't start watching Charmed until the reruns starting airing on TNT.  I don't know why because I love the supernatural shows but for some reason I got into the show late.  Once, I started watching the reruns then I didn't miss any of the new episodes on the WB.  I have to agree with everyone else in saying that Season 3 is the best, mainly because of the character Cole joining the storyline.  He is just wonderful to watch.  Even though this is the best season, it is sad that Shannon left at the end.  When you watch the first 2 seasons you can see that the actresses really get along well and they definitely have chemistry on the screen but when Season 3 gets rolling you know that something is different even if you didn't read all the gossip headlines.  You can see the rift between Shannon and Alyssa in the show especially towards the end of Season 3 when they hardly appear in scenes together.  It is truly sad that they were once so close that Shannon was a bridesmaid for Alyssa in her wedding and now they don't even speak.  I think all the actresses (including Rose) are extremely talented and they're all an important part of the show. It would be great if Shannon could return at least once in awhile then they could be the \"Power of Four\".  Now, that would be a twist in the show!!  I doubt that would ever happen due to the situation with Shannon and Alyssa along with the other people involved with the show.  I don't think Shannon left on a good note but it would be nice for them to repair the damage and in turn do a great thing for the show.  Anyhow, this was a great season as well as the others and worth the purchase.  I will definitely have the entire Charmed series in my DVD collection!  Can't wait for the other seasons to be released.  Hopefully, the future season collections will have some special bonus material.  Maybe, they can add the unaired pilot to the last season's DVD release since it wasn't included in the first season's collection like it should have been.  As usual, there are rumors that this season (2005-2006) will be the last.

It's been so long since I have seen the show that I only remember bits and pieces so it will be great to see Fame again.  This DVD collection is a must have for any Fame, 80's or dance fan!!  I hope they keep releasing the other seasons as well!!

A giant meteor struck Antarctica in 2000, devastating much of the Earth. Since then, humans and the mysterious aliens known as Angels have been locked in a deadly struggle. In 2015, scientists at the NERV Center in the fortress-city of Tokyo 3 are developing ways to combat the Angels, notably the Human Enhancement Project and the giant battle robots called Evangelions. Fourteen-year-old Shinji Ikari, whose aloof father heads these research projects, is drafted to pilot Evangelion Unit 01. Shinji is a reluctant hero, as many mecha pilots are, but his reluctance is not just an arbitrary whim; it's rooted in his estrangement from his father. Shy and socially maladroit, Shinji displays a likable warmth the grimly taciturn teenagers in ordinary mecha shows lack. Rounding out the cast are Rei Ayanami, the silent, albino pilot of Unit 00; irrepressible Misato Katsuragi, who serves as a substitute mother to Shinji; technical expert Ritsuko Akagi; and Shinji's classmates Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida. Evangelion offers a dark vision of the future, but director Hideaki Anno presents it very skillfully. Episodes include: 1. \"Angel Attack,\" 2. \"Unfamiliar Ceiling,\" 3. \"The Phone That Never Rings,\" 4. \"Rain, Escape & Afterwards.\" Not rated; suitable for ages 14 and up: robot vs. robot violence, brief nudity, and minor profanity. --Charles Solomon \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Okay, Neon Genesis Evangelion is, of course, the best Anime, the best show, one of the best pieces of art, ever created, and this DVD is wonderful because it contains 4 episodes as opposed to the normal 2 on VHS  for the same price... and on the DVD you can laugh and watch it in English  or french or spanish (for those of you who watch Eva or any other anime  dubbed, shame on you)....  However, something that pissed me off and will  probably leave other fans slighly steamed is the fact that the DVD version  changes some of the frames that have words written in Japanese and  digitally removes the Japanese versions and puts English versions of the  frame in instead of just translating it under the Japanese like the VHS  version.  For instance, the chore sheet that Shinji and Misato are creating  in the second episode is in English... (such is the case with a lot of  frames).  It didn't seem like such a big deal when I heard about it, but  after I have seen it, it really pisses me off.  But of course it does not  ruin the DVD at all because the series is so awesome, it just takes away a  little bit of the authenticity.-------\nItem title: Perfect Blue (rated edition) [VHS] \n Item description: Amazon.com One of the most ambitious animated films to come out of Japan (or anywhere, for that matter), Perfect Blue is an adult psycho-thriller that uses the freedom of the animated image to create the subjective reality of a young actress haunted by the ghost of her past identity. Mima is a singer who leaves her teeny-bop trio to become an actress in a violent television series, a career move that angers her fans, who prefer to see her as the pert, squeaky-clean pop idol. Plagued by self-doubt and tormented by humiliating compromises, she begins to be stalked, in her waking and sleeping moments, by an accusing alter ego who claims to be \"the real Mima,\" until she collapses into madness as her coworkers are brutally slain around her. Director Satoshi Kon, adapting the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, shows us the world from her schizophrenic perspective: days blur, dreams cross over into the waking world, the TV show blends into her real life, until her life merges with her part and she can't separate the ghosts from the real-life stalkers. Though the pat ending sweeps the psychosis and anxiety away with nary an emotional scar, it remains a smart, stylish thriller and one of the most intelligent and compelling uses of animation in recent years. Though tame by the extreme standards of \"adult anime,\" there is nudity and a few sexually provocative scenes, and the animation is detailed and stylized (if somewhat stiff and jerky by Disney standards). --Sean Axmaker \n rating: 3.0 \n review: I saw this film in theaters about 2 months ago, and it was awesome!  It is one of the best anime's I have ever seen: the animation is wonderful and chilling, the characters are very well developed, and the music is  brilliant... but the dub is TERRIBLE!  It sounds like the voice actors  read &amp; recorded the script without even practicing once.  Some of the  scenes you can just tell would be so awesome in the original Japanese... so  buy the film, just buy it subbed!  Sure it's a bit more expensive but it's  worth it.  Plus, they actually HAVE it subbed on amazon, which is pretty  rare coz I've looked all over the net for a subbed copy and this is the  only place that has it.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey there, I really enjoy thought-provoking and deep anime shows, so if you have any recommendations along those lines, feel free to suggest them to me!\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

I purchased this set on recommendation of a friend.  We homeschool and science is EXTREMELY important to us-one of the reasons we homeschool is because we don't feel public schools really get kids interested in science and because my husband is a scientist he can see more of the ins and outs and how important it is to encourage kids to learn about science (if you're good at it you can really earn some good money too!).  This is well put together and I'm glad it has all of them.  My 4 1/2 year old (who is very smart and advanced for his age-I say this not to brag but possibly most 4 1/2 year olds wouldn't be so engrossed by this or understand it quite as well?) and 2 year old sat watching two episodes as we ate lunch today and both are just begging for more.  We are using Apologia science specifically the one about Human Anatomy and Physiology right now so I'm using it to compliment what I'm teaching him with the hands-on approach Apologia uses.  I believe in helping kids use as many of their senses as possible to learn their subjects so this is really helping explain information in a different way.<br /><br />My ONLY con of this is they don't seem to be in order of when they were released nor do they have any of that information if you wanted to watch all of them in order.  As the stories don't build upon each other some may not think this is a big deal but I think it would be nice to know-it doesn't lose a star over this but something to note.  Also the quality of the picture could probably be cleaned up a little but since it's a hand drawn cartoon (at least I'm pretty sure on that since it's over 25 years old) that may not be possible.  The sound quality and everything was fine.<br /><br />I recommend this to all parents-whether you homeschool or not-to help your kids learn science and get interested in it.  Watch it with them!  Ask questions!  Sure it may be cheesy to the parents but there's great information in there that you can also use to help you remember these science topics.-------\nItem title: Impractical Jokers: The Complete Fifth Season (DVD) \n Item description: Impractical Jokers: The Complete Fifth Season (DVD) See why the New York Post called Impractical Jokers \u201cPossibly the funniest, most ridiculous show I\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d Once you start watching, you just can't stop!

Q, Sal, Joe and Murr are back at it again to compete in a series of the most hilarious dares ever, recorded by hidden cameras in Impractical Jokers: The Complete Fifth Season on DVD! ]]> \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Gets a star knocked off for missing \u201cBritish Invasion.\u201d This episode was supposed to be on the end of disc 2 or beginning of disc 3 (between \u201cBrowbeaten\u201d and \u201cCoward\u201d). This set can\u2019t claim to be the entire season when it\u2019s missing a full episode. When we saw it missing from the set before, we thought it would be on the next. This season correlates to season 8 and season 9 on Prime video. British Invasion is episode 1 on Prime\u2019s season 9. Now we will have to buy the individual episode because they seemed to have stopped making DVDs. Just a warning for others who may be deciding between buying the seasons separately on prime or as the DVD, this package doesn\u2019t include an episode.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, I enjoy shows with strong relationships and quirky characters, so I'd love a recommendation for a TV series along those lines!\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

I find the instructor, Stella Sandoval, interesting and motivating without being too over the top. I like her style and energy. I have no trouble following the routines just by watching her on the screen. The steps are simple enough to do without her having to break down each step. With her as the lone instructor I am having no trouble following. There is no extraneous noise or movement on the set. Also; she is being viewed from different camera angles; therefore, making it easier to see her body movement, etc.<br /><br />Having stated the above, I do think that I should tell you that I am a relative beginner to this. I have used some videos in the past to work out with. However; I had a fairly serious accident 4 years ago and have not got back to working out with videos until just recently.

Season Four of Mad Men , 3-time Emmy\u00ae winner for Outstanding Drama Series and winner of 3 consecutive Golden Globes\u00ae, returns for a new year rife with possibilities. Last season stunned fans with its cliffhanger finale, as Don Draper\u2019s professional and personal lives unexpectedly imploded. In Season 4, Jon Hamm and the rest of the breakout ensemble continue to captivate us as they grapple with an uncertain new reality. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I got hooked off season 1 about 5 weeks ago. Before long I was buying season 3 on blueray, and now I'm impatiently about to pre-order season 4. I don't want to watch any episodes of season 4 until I'm fully caught up. This is a great series with a great story line, and line up character profiles. Peggy is definitley stepping it up  so far in season 3.-------\nItem title: Passengers \n Item description: Product Description While helping a handful of plane crash survivors cope with their grief, young psychologist Claire Summers (2008 Best Actress, Oscar\u00ae nominee Anne Hathaway, Rachel Getting Married) begins to uncover conflicting accounts of the accident. At first, Claire believes that trauma is behind her patients' wildly different stories - until the survivors mysteriously begin disappearing one by one. Now Eric (Patrick Wilson, Lakeview Terrace), a surviving passenger she has grown dangerously close to, may hold the key to unlocking the truth about the tragic incident in this shocking psychological thriller. Amazon.com Academy Award nominee Anne Hathaway leads an impressive cast in this supernatural-tinged thriller from director Rodrigo Garcia ( Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her ). Hathaway is typically fine as a novice therapist assigned to the survivors of a horrific plane crash; all are traumatized save one (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen ), who exudes a newfound joie de vivre as well as a serious yen for Hathaway. As the mismatched pair grows closer, the survivors begin to disappear, spurring Hathaway into an investigation into what exactly transpired during the doomed flight. Though the two leads are a photogenic pair, they\u2019re continually underserved by the script, which serves up an alarming array of red herrings and false steps; Garcia does his best to impart the same sort of layered, multi-character structure to Passengers he brought to his arthouse dramas like Nine Lives , but the material is too thin and derivative to afford him much traction. The terrific supporting cast, which includes Andre Braugher, Dianne Wiest, Clea Duvall, David Morse, and, appropriately enough, William B. Davis-- The X-Files \u2019 Cancer Man--is also left stranded by the script. --Paul Gaita \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I'll make this simple: (1) The group of actors are simply amazing, and you can't go wrong with Anne Hathaway. The storyline was intense, and left you suprised. It was rather sad to be honest, but I enjoy a good movie. It left bit of suspense, mystery, romance, eye candy, and hope that things always workout in their own way. If you like anne hathaway, watch this!-------\nItem title: Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues \n Item description: With the 70's behind him, San Diego's top rated newsman, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), returns to the news desk in 'Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.' Also back for more are Ron's co-anchor and wife, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), weather man Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), man on the street Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) and sports guy Champ Kind (David Koechner) - All of whom won't make it easy to stay classy... while taking the nation's first 24-hour news channel by storm. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I saw this opening night and loved it. The humor was raw (not for the weak), suprising cameo's,  and refreshing to see this finally come out. If you loved the first one SEE THIS!  It was interesting see how they mocked an idea that is now on every major news channel. In a wierd kind of way this gives you a better perspective of how things worked way back then.  Enjoy everyone!!!!-------\nItem title: The Stoning of Soraya M \n Item description: Product Description From a producer of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST comes this chilling true story. Academy Award\u00ae nominee Shorheh Aghdashloo stars as Zahra, a woman with a burning secret. When a journalist (Jim Caviezel) is stranded in her remote village, Zahra takes a bold chance to reveal what the villagers will stop at nothing to hide. Thus begins the story of Soraya (Mozhan Marn\u00f2), a kind woman whose cruel, divorce- seeking husband trumps up false charges of infidelity against her, which carry an unimaginable penalty. Soraya and Zahra attempt to navigate the villagers\u2019 scheming, lies and deceit to prove her innocence. But when all else fails, Zahra must risk everything to use the only weapon she has left \u2013 her voice \u2013 to share Soraya's shocking story with the world. Amazon.com In the most powerful motion pictures, the message tends to be embedded so deeply that it isn't always apparent at first glance. In The Stoning of Soraya M. , the point of the project--to bring a heinous cultural practice to light--drowns out all other concerns. The film is based on Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam\u2019s international bestselling non-fiction book of the same title. Sahebjam (played by Jim Caviezel, in a framing device) stumbles across the story in 1986 when his car breaks down in a remote Iranian village and he meets Zahra ( House of Sand and Fog 's Shohreh Aghdashloo), who begs him to tell the world what happened to her niece, Soraya. After 21 years of marriage, Soraya's abusive husband, Ali, falls in love with a 14-year-old, but Soraya (Mozhan Marn\u00f2) resists divorce for fear he'll leave her penniless, so Ali falsely accuses her of infidelity, convinces the town elders to get on board, and the mayor sentences her to death by stoning. Though Cyrus Nowrasteh directs, The Passion of the Christ producer Steven McEveety's guiding hand is keenly felt as a blameless individual must suffer for the sins of others, but the film would generate more sympathy and outrage if the characters registered as vividly as the message (see Silkwood for a superior example of character-based outrage). The actors, including Caviezel--affecting a passable accent--invest their mono-dimensional roles with conviction, but this literary adaptation would've worked better as a documentary that examines the history of honor killings, including the legal and political repercussions. --Kathleen C. Fennessy \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is truly a must for everyone to see. Coming from the middle east I often hear about movies that give muslim cultures a bad rap.  Unfortunately, there are some acts still being done that make this a reality. Stoning in my opinion is one of them. I don't usually shed a tear during movies, but the end was very tough to watch.  The director was actually threatened by some people, and the government denied that stoning is still done.

Season Four of Mad Men , 3-time Emmy\u00ae winner for Outstanding Drama Series and winner of 3 consecutive Golden Globes\u00ae, returns for a new year rife with possibilities. Last season stunned fans with its cliffhanger finale, as Don Draper\u2019s professional and personal lives unexpectedly imploded. In Season 4, Jon Hamm and the rest of the breakout ensemble continue to captivate us as they grapple with an uncertain new reality. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I got hooked off season 1 about 5 weeks ago. Before long I was buying season 3 on blueray, and now I'm impatiently about to pre-order season 4. I don't want to watch any episodes of season 4 until I'm fully caught up. This is a great series with a great story line, and line up character profiles. Peggy is definitley stepping it up  so far in season 3.-------\nItem title: Passengers \n Item description: Product Description While helping a handful of plane crash survivors cope with their grief, young psychologist Claire Summers (2008 Best Actress, Oscar\u00ae nominee Anne Hathaway, Rachel Getting Married) begins to uncover conflicting accounts of the accident. At first, Claire believes that trauma is behind her patients' wildly different stories - until the survivors mysteriously begin disappearing one by one. Now Eric (Patrick Wilson, Lakeview Terrace), a surviving passenger she has grown dangerously close to, may hold the key to unlocking the truth about the tragic incident in this shocking psychological thriller. Amazon.com Academy Award nominee Anne Hathaway leads an impressive cast in this supernatural-tinged thriller from director Rodrigo Garcia ( Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her ). Hathaway is typically fine as a novice therapist assigned to the survivors of a horrific plane crash; all are traumatized save one (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen ), who exudes a newfound joie de vivre as well as a serious yen for Hathaway. As the mismatched pair grows closer, the survivors begin to disappear, spurring Hathaway into an investigation into what exactly transpired during the doomed flight. Though the two leads are a photogenic pair, they\u2019re continually underserved by the script, which serves up an alarming array of red herrings and false steps; Garcia does his best to impart the same sort of layered, multi-character structure to Passengers he brought to his arthouse dramas like Nine Lives , but the material is too thin and derivative to afford him much traction. The terrific supporting cast, which includes Andre Braugher, Dianne Wiest, Clea Duvall, David Morse, and, appropriately enough, William B. Davis-- The X-Files \u2019 Cancer Man--is also left stranded by the script. --Paul Gaita \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I'll make this simple: (1) The group of actors are simply amazing, and you can't go wrong with Anne Hathaway. The storyline was intense, and left you suprised. It was rather sad to be honest, but I enjoy a good movie. It left bit of suspense, mystery, romance, eye candy, and hope that things always workout in their own way. If you like anne hathaway, watch this!-------\nItem title: Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues \n Item description: With the 70's behind him, San Diego's top rated newsman, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), returns to the news desk in 'Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.' Also back for more are Ron's co-anchor and wife, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), weather man Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), man on the street Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) and sports guy Champ Kind (David Koechner) - All of whom won't make it easy to stay classy... while taking the nation's first 24-hour news channel by storm. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I saw this opening night and loved it. The humor was raw (not for the weak), suprising cameo's,  and refreshing to see this finally come out. If you loved the first one SEE THIS!  It was interesting see how they mocked an idea that is now on every major news channel. In a wierd kind of way this gives you a better perspective of how things worked way back then.  Enjoy everyone!!!!-------\nItem title: The Stoning of Soraya M \n Item description: Product Description From a producer of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST comes this chilling true story. Academy Award\u00ae nominee Shorheh Aghdashloo stars as Zahra, a woman with a burning secret. When a journalist (Jim Caviezel) is stranded in her remote village, Zahra takes a bold chance to reveal what the villagers will stop at nothing to hide. Thus begins the story of Soraya (Mozhan Marn\u00f2), a kind woman whose cruel, divorce- seeking husband trumps up false charges of infidelity against her, which carry an unimaginable penalty. Soraya and Zahra attempt to navigate the villagers\u2019 scheming, lies and deceit to prove her innocence. But when all else fails, Zahra must risk everything to use the only weapon she has left \u2013 her voice \u2013 to share Soraya's shocking story with the world. Amazon.com In the most powerful motion pictures, the message tends to be embedded so deeply that it isn't always apparent at first glance. In The Stoning of Soraya M. , the point of the project--to bring a heinous cultural practice to light--drowns out all other concerns. The film is based on Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam\u2019s international bestselling non-fiction book of the same title. Sahebjam (played by Jim Caviezel, in a framing device) stumbles across the story in 1986 when his car breaks down in a remote Iranian village and he meets Zahra ( House of Sand and Fog 's Shohreh Aghdashloo), who begs him to tell the world what happened to her niece, Soraya. After 21 years of marriage, Soraya's abusive husband, Ali, falls in love with a 14-year-old, but Soraya (Mozhan Marn\u00f2) resists divorce for fear he'll leave her penniless, so Ali falsely accuses her of infidelity, convinces the town elders to get on board, and the mayor sentences her to death by stoning. Though Cyrus Nowrasteh directs, The Passion of the Christ producer Steven McEveety's guiding hand is keenly felt as a blameless individual must suffer for the sins of others, but the film would generate more sympathy and outrage if the characters registered as vividly as the message (see Silkwood for a superior example of character-based outrage). The actors, including Caviezel--affecting a passable accent--invest their mono-dimensional roles with conviction, but this literary adaptation would've worked better as a documentary that examines the history of honor killings, including the legal and political repercussions. --Kathleen C. Fennessy \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is truly a must for everyone to see. Coming from the middle east I often hear about movies that give muslim cultures a bad rap.  Unfortunately, there are some acts still being done that make this a reality. Stoning in my opinion is one of them. I don't usually shed a tear during movies, but the end was very tough to watch.  The director was actually threatened by some people, and the government denied that stoning is still done. I have a hard time believing  that's the case.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy shows with great humor, realistic scenarios, and strong character dynamics, so I'm looking for something that can make me laugh and keep me entertained, maybe something with a unique workplace setting.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Yet they keep trying their luck in one frontier outpost after another. And though cardsharps Bret and Bart would just as soon slip out of town quietly as face a gunman, when it's time for a showdown, don't bet against a Maverick. ]]> Amazon.com One of the most consistently entertaining shows from Television's Golden Age, this witty meta-Western has lost little of its oomph over the years, thanks to the easy, slightly amoral charm of James Garner, as a hero whose speed on the draw isn't half as important as what's going on underneath his hat. Created by Roy Huggins ( The Fugitive ), the series follows the adventures of Bret Maverick (Garner), a professional gambler who travels across the plains and prairies looking for the next big game. As the show's popularity increased, the saga expanded with the introduction of Bret's brother Bart (Jack Kelly), a slightly more conservative figure who nonetheless shares his sibling's knack for capitalizing on a double-deal. Admittedly, this introductory season does take a while to distinguish itself from the run-of-the-mill oater, with the first half-dozen episodes functioning as more-or-less traditional genre fare. (The combination of Garner and legendary director Budd Boetticher, however, makes viewing far from a chore.) Once it finds its groove, though, look out, as the show settles into an amiable blend of comedy and action that has rarely been equaled. Throughout these 27 episodes, the wandering nature of the premise allows Maverick to amble into an impressive variety of situations, including ghost stories, adventures at sea (the Bret and Bart combo episode \"The Wrecker,\" based on a story by Robert Louis Stevenson), tense saloon standoffs (\"The Quick and the Dead,\" featuring Gerald Mohr as a spooky Doc Holliday), and courtroom dramas (the superb \"Rope of Cards,\" which also introduces Bret's highly addictive variation on solitaire). Entertaining as the plots could be, however, Maverick proves to be at its best when it kicks back and allows its title characters to ply their trade at the tables, especially when the competition includes one of the show's unusually strong female characters, particularly the recurring foil (and fellow cardsharp) Samantha Crawford, played by the delightful Diane Brewster. (Garner, as in the later Huggins-created The Rockford Files , displays particular energy when paired with a costar who gives as good as she gets.) While this compilation features little in the way of extras, Western fans should find it pleasure enough to watch a series whose softly ironic charms have been often imitated, but never quite duplicated.

Sometimes that's literally the chemicals used by Dr. Maura Isles (Sasha Alexander), the forensic pathologist who, as medical examiner, figures out what killed the victims whose murderers Boston detective Jane Rizzoli (Angie Harmon) is trying to bring to justice. More often, it's the chemistry between the two title characters that's at the heart of this series. This pair is a younger, much sexier, distaff answer to The Odd Couple , with Isles the meticulous, sometimes prissy Felix to Rizzoli's less analytical, more cynical Oscar. They're both good at their jobs, of course; Isles's knowledge about just about everything is almost laughably encyclopedic, while Rizzoli is an intuitive, courageous cop. But though the procedural aspect of the show is detailed and reasonably involving (this season they deal with vicious rapes, fire bombings, and ice pick killings; there are also fairly preposterous episodes involving a modern-day witch hunt, a baseball star run amok, a So You Think You Can Dance -type competition, and more), it's the constant banter between these two mismatched best friends that fuels the episodes. They talk about man issues; Maura's hot but naive, Rizzoli's skeptical, and both are single. And they have family issues--boy, do they have family issues, what with Jane's mother (Lorraine Bracco) in extreme bitter mode over her impending divorce and her wayward youngest brother having just been released from prison (her other brother's a cop), while Maura's biological dad is a notorious mobster who long ago somehow hooked up with her beautiful socialite mother, played by Jacqueline Bisset. Much of this is presented with an appealing light touch. Notwithstanding some gruesome cases, Rizzoli & Isles is not a gritty show; in fact, there's enough cutesy stuff, even when they're on the job, to make it hard to take the crimes seriously. But with Harmon and Alexander around, crime novelist Tess Gerritsen's works remain in good hands. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I haven't been able to watch the show on TV, but I love the books.

But though the procedural aspect of the show is detailed and reasonably involving (this season they deal with vicious rapes, fire bombings, and ice pick killings; there are also fairly preposterous episodes involving a modern-day witch hunt, a baseball star run amok, a So You Think You Can Dance -type competition, and more), it's the constant banter between these two mismatched best friends that fuels the episodes. They talk about man issues; Maura's hot but naive, Rizzoli's skeptical, and both are single. And they have family issues--boy, do they have family issues, what with Jane's mother (Lorraine Bracco) in extreme bitter mode over her impending divorce and her wayward youngest brother having just been released from prison (her other brother's a cop), while Maura's biological dad is a notorious mobster who long ago somehow hooked up with her beautiful socialite mother, played by Jacqueline Bisset. Much of this is presented with an appealing light touch. Notwithstanding some gruesome cases, Rizzoli & Isles is not a gritty show; in fact, there's enough cutesy stuff, even when they're on the job, to make it hard to take the crimes seriously. But with Harmon and Alexander around, crime novelist Tess Gerritsen's works remain in good hands. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I haven't been able to watch the show on TV, but I love the books.

Oliver, a feisty young cat, explores New York in this thrilling animated classic cleverly based on Charles Dickens' timeless story, OLIVER TWIST -- featuring unforgettable songs performed by musical greats Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and Bette Midler! Joined by a pack of hilarious characters -- dogs Dodger, Tito and their pals -- Oliver knows he's found a lifelong friend and a real home.

Hightail it to your home theater for a fun and exciting movie-watching experience your family will enjoy again and again!|Disney presents an animated version of the the Oliver Twist story with a twist -\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the setting is New York, Oliver is a kitten, and Fagin is the human master of a pack of pickpocket dogs.|Six supervising animators and a team of more than 300 artists and technicians worked for more than two and a half years to create this hand-drawn feature film. More than a million story sketches and drawings were required to produce the 119,275 hand-painted cels that comprise the finished film.|Designers went to New York and photographed street scenes from a dog's perspective \u00e2\u0080\u0093- 18 inches off the ground -\u00e2\u0080\u0093 getting stares from passersby but providing excellent reference material for the layout artists.|To give the backgrounds a contemporary and hard-edged look, animators used Xerox overlays for the first time since 101 DALMATIANS.|Many of the inanimate objects in the film were created and animated on the computer \u00e2\u0080\u0093- cars, cabs, buses, Sykes' limousine, Fagin's trike (part scooter and part shopping cart), a cement mixer, a sewer pipe, a spiral staircase, a piano, subway tunnels and trains, cityscapes, and even the Brooklyn Bridge. This was the first film to have its own department set up expressly for the purpose of generating computer animation. Amazon.com Based on Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist,\" Disney's Oliver and Company was one of the first animated features to incorporate computer images with traditional hand-drawn animation and features the music and voice talents of pop-music giants like Billy Joel, Huey Lewis, and Bette Midler. A traditional story set in the modern world, Oliver and Company is the story of a stray kitten who wanders the streets of New York in search of a loving family. When Oliver encounters a street-wise dog named Dodger, the dog begins to teach him about life in the big city and takes him home to his family of street dogs and their master Fagan. Fagan and his dogs Dodger, Tito, Einstein, Francis, and Rita must often resort to thievery just to survive and during a particularly daring caper, Oliver gets separated from the other dogs and winds up meeting Jenny, a young rich girl with a big heart.

Amazon.com A 1989 teen fantasy, Teen Witch is a somewhat corny, music-filled film about love, magic, and truth. Most teenagers dream of having the power to make anything happen. According to local mystic Madame Serena (Zelda Rubinstein), that's just what's going to happen to Louise (Robyn Lively) on her 16th birthday when she receives her powers as a witch. The once shy and unpopular Louise takes full advantage of her new abilities and is soon enjoying being the most popular girl in school, dating the star of the football team (Dan Gauthier), and terrorizing a particularly insensitive teacher (Shelley Berman). What Louise is slower to learn is the wisdom of being careful what she wishes for, that wishes sometimes have unintended consequences, and that when it comes to love, magic can cloud the truth. In the end, Louise will have to make a very personal choice between magic and truth and come to terms with the fact that, like spells, happiness gained by magic wears off. Perhaps a more powerful magic stems from believing in oneself. Teen Witch provides a comical look back at the 1980s, complete with mediocre, generally irrelevant musical numbers and shallow, simplistic characters.

More than a million story sketches and drawings were required to produce the 119,275 hand-painted cels that comprise the finished film.|Designers went to New York and photographed street scenes from a dog's perspective \u00e2\u0080\u0093- 18 inches off the ground -\u00e2\u0080\u0093 getting stares from passersby but providing excellent reference material for the layout artists.|To give the backgrounds a contemporary and hard-edged look, animators used Xerox overlays for the first time since 101 DALMATIANS.|Many of the inanimate objects in the film were created and animated on the computer \u00e2\u0080\u0093- cars, cabs, buses, Sykes' limousine, Fagin's trike (part scooter and part shopping cart), a cement mixer, a sewer pipe, a spiral staircase, a piano, subway tunnels and trains, cityscapes, and even the Brooklyn Bridge. This was the first film to have its own department set up expressly for the purpose of generating computer animation. Amazon.com Based on Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist,\" Disney's Oliver and Company was one of the first animated features to incorporate computer images with traditional hand-drawn animation and features the music and voice talents of pop-music giants like Billy Joel, Huey Lewis, and Bette Midler. A traditional story set in the modern world, Oliver and Company is the story of a stray kitten who wanders the streets of New York in search of a loving family. When Oliver encounters a street-wise dog named Dodger, the dog begins to teach him about life in the big city and takes him home to his family of street dogs and their master Fagan. Fagan and his dogs Dodger, Tito, Einstein, Francis, and Rita must often resort to thievery just to survive and during a particularly daring caper, Oliver gets separated from the other dogs and winds up meeting Jenny, a young rich girl with a big heart. As Oliver revels in Jenny's affection and begins to feel like part of her family, the dogs set out to rescue Oliver thinking he's been kidnapped.

When he moves to the city, and achieves great success as a televangelist, he thinks he\u2019s finally fulfilling God\u2019s plan. It\u2019s only when he almost loses his new ministry, and the woman he loves, that he finds the courage to become the man God truly called him to be. Starring Angus Benfield, Victoria Abbott and Jeremy Brennan, THE HOLY ROLLER shows us that the only thing more important than having the faith to begin \u2026 is the courage to begin again. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Nice movie-------\nItem title: DVD - Triple Feature: Esther/Apostle Peter & Last Supper/Book Of Ruth (3 DVD) \n Item description: The Book of Esther: Good battles evil in this timeless story of Biblical heroism. The righteous Jew Mordecai and the despicable Haman square off for control of the young Persian King Xerxes, but Haman's plans include something horrible for Mordecai and his people. It is up to Mordecai's niece, Esther to win the affection of the King, unmask Haman's treachery, and save the Jewish people. Based upon the Book of Esther, this delightful retelling emphasizes the values of courage, faith and obedience. Apostle Peter and the Last Supper: Relive the time Peter spent with Jesus, from the Great Commission to the life-changing Last Supper and the garden of Gethsemane. Set in Rome A.D. 67, two jailers at the ancient Mamertine Prison take custody of a famous criminal. He is Simon Peter of Galilee - apostle, disciple, and personal friend of Jesus, also called The Christ. Condemned to death, the elderly Peter (Robert Loggia) recounts his life as a simple fisherman who became one of the boldest figures in all of Christianity. As Peter prepares to depart this earthly life, he will make an unforgettable impression on his jailers through the saving power of the Gospel. The Book of Ruth: The Book of Ruth is a triumphant love story in the face of adversity. This selfless journey of love and devotion is seen through the eyes of a young widow. Choosing to leave her homeland of Moab, she follows her mother-in-law Naomi to Israel after the death of her husband. Upon reaching Bethlehem, she meets and marries a man named Boaz, who is of the Royal House of Judah. This chain of seemingly unrelated events sets the stage for the future kings of the nation of Israel, and the glorious coming of the Messiah. A Biblical Cinderella story from the archives of the royal Jewish bloodline, this story reveals the redemption of their inheritance through the child Obed, who was the grandfather of David. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Excellent!-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy watching movies that focus on faith and inspiration, so I'm looking for something that aligns with those themes.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Alone with only the base's vigilant computer Gerty (voiced by Oscar-Winner Kevin Spacey, 1999 Best Actor, American Beauty ) as his sole companion, Bell's extended isolation has taken its toll. His only link to the outside world comes from satellite messages from his wife and young daughter. He longs to return home, but a terrible accident on the lunar surface leads to a disturbing discovery that contributes to his growing sense of paranoia and dislocation so many miles away from home. Moon is an engrossing, intelligent sci-fi thriller that ranks with genre classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey . Amazon.com Science fiction can encompass many genres--suspense, horror, action-adventure, romance, even comedy--but director Duncan Jones's Moon doesn't fit neatly into any of them. This smart, provocative film has no aliens or cool spaceships, and the effects (mostly consisting of model vehicles lumbering across the lunar surface) aren't all that special; instead, the material is character- and story-driven, centering on an excellent, multilayered performance by Sam Rockwell. The scene is some undetermined point in the future. Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an employee of Lunar Industries, the company responsible for mining a fusion energy source called Helium-3, which is vital to Earth's efforts to reverse a serious energy crisis and can only be found on the far side of the Moon. Sam is all by himself, and as he nears the end of his three-year contract, the solitude is starting to get to him (\"Three years is a long haul,\" he says. \"Way, way, way too long. I'm talking to myself on a regular basis\"); his only contact with his wife and daughter back home comes through the occasional video messages he exchanges with them, while his sole interaction on the Moon is with GERTY 3000, a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey (and an obvious parallel to 2001: A Space Odyssey 's HAL 9000). Things start to go seriously sideways when Sam crashes his vehicle while out inspecting one of the giant Helium-3 harvesters. He comes to in the base infirmary, seemingly none the worse for the wear; but an unnerving surprise awaits him when he goes back to check out the accident site, and the resulting complications occupy the rest of the movie. Fans of 2001 , Solaris , and other cerebral sci-fi will enjoy figuring out what's going on; others will find it slow-moving and tedious. Either way, Moon , which was made quickly and on a relatively low budget, is well worth a look. --Sam Graham \n rating: 4.0 \n review: The concept of the movie is really cool...but there never really seems to be an overwhelming climax.  Granted there is a climax, it just seems like it meanders along.  Like the title says, rent it; not one of my finest purchases.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I'm in the mood for a thought-provoking sci-fi movie with impressive special effects and a unique story.

He comes to in the base infirmary, seemingly none the worse for the wear; but an unnerving surprise awaits him when he goes back to check out the accident site, and the resulting complications occupy the rest of the movie. Fans of 2001 , Solaris , and other cerebral sci-fi will enjoy figuring out what's going on; others will find it slow-moving and tedious. Either way, Moon , which was made quickly and on a relatively low budget, is well worth a look. --Sam Graham \n rating: 4.0 \n review: The concept of the movie is really cool...but there never really seems to be an overwhelming climax.  Granted there is a climax, it just seems like it meanders along.  Like the title says, rent it; not one of my finest purchases.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I'm in the mood for a thought-provoking sci-fi movie with impressive special effects and a unique story.

Based on the Tony Award-winning Broadway play, and set against the sweeping canvas of World War I, this deeply heartfelt story begins with the remarkable friendship between a horse named Joey and his young trainer Albert. When they\u2019re forced apart by war, we follow Joey\u2019s extraordinary journey as he changes and inspires the lives of everyone he meets. Filled with spectacularly rich visuals \u2014 and complete with never-before-seen bonus features \u2014 War Horse is a \u201cGenuine movie masterpiece,\u201d (Rex Reed, The New York Observer) and one of the most powerful and moving stories of friendship ever told. Amazon.com The sheer physical beauty of the horse and the magnificent landscape of rural Devon, England, makes the first section of War Horse a feast for the eyes, as stalwart young lad Albert (Jeremy Irvine, in his film debut) struggles to channel the high-strung energy of newly bought horse Joey into plowing a rocky field. A destructive rainstorm forces Albert's father (Peter Mullan, Boy A ) to sell Joey to an army captain (Tom Hiddleston, Thor ) who takes the horse into the battlefields of World War I. From there, turns of fortune lead Joey into the hands of a German private, a French girl and her grandfather, and then into the cratered no man's land between the warring armies. War Horse is jarringly uneven. Some moments are over-the-top while others are elegantly understated; the tone ranges from the broad comedy of a mid-1970s Disney live-action flick to the raw majesty of a John Ford western. The episodic storytelling doesn't help--the characters don't have time to fully establish themselves in the audience's hearts, despite some excellent performances. The greatest weakness is that director Steven Spielberg doesn't connect us to Joey himself; though it's impossible not to have moments of empathy with the trials of this beautiful animal, at other times the horse is no more than a narrative device, carrying us from one micro-story to another. Still, some episodes are unquestionably compelling (a sequence in which a British and a German soldier collaborate to rescue Joey is particularly good) and, though stylistically all over the place, War Horse is never less than visually stunning. -- Bret Fetzer \n rating: 5.0 \n review: To complete our WWI unit I show this movie to my students.

L. Travers\u2019 (Thompson) beloved book. Armed with his iconic creative vision, Walt pulls out all the stops, but the uncompromising Travers won\u2019t budge.

Amazon.com Saving Mr. Banks is a fascinating look at the circuitous \"collaborative\" process Walt Disney, his creative team, and author P.L. Travers engaged in in bringing the character Mary Poppins to life on the big screen in the early 1960s. This touching, funny film is really two stories nicely tied up in one appealing package. The first story is of P.L. Travers's childhood in Australia in the early 1900s. This story starts out idyllically enough, emphasizing her father's immense love for his children and his uncanny ability to make everything fun and exciting, but it's one that has a darker side that ends up shaping the adult that Travers eventually becomes. The other story is of the adult P.L. Travers. A proper Englishwoman completely set in her ways, she grudgingly embarks on a trip from England to Los Angeles to discuss the possibility of turning her highly successful book Mary Poppins into a Disney motion picture. Walt Disney has a vested personal interest in the project, but Travers and the Disney team clash on virtually every level and their interactions run the gamut from perplexing to infuriating and downright funny. The juxtaposition of the two stories is quite masterful, with the stories continually intertwining and each shedding light on the other to create a cohesive film that is highly engaging and emotionally poignant. The casting of Tom Hanks as Disney and Emma Thompson as Travers is inspired: they are absolutely perfect in their roles.
