Charm, looks, style, and he's about to marry the daughter of the most powerful man in Hollywood. But a funny thing happens on his way to the altar ... he meets sultry Las Vegas lounge singer Vicki Anderson. And it's lust at first sight! Charley discovers the hard way that his attraction to Vicki is going to get him into trouble over and over again! Handsome Alec Baldwin (IT S COMPLICATED, 30 ROCK) and sexy Kim Basinger (BATMAN, 8 MILE) heat up the screen in one of the most sizzling and funny romances in modern courtship history! See for yourself what all the heat's about! Review Hot gets you into trouble, cautions high-living 1940s-era playboy Alec Baldwin. He doesn't know the half of it. Days before his marriage to Hollywood studio heiress Elisabeth Shue, he falls madly in bed with shapely lounge singer Kim Basinger and ends up in an unlikely shotgun marriage. They divorce, they remarry, they divorce, they... you get the picture. Baldwin, all cool confidence in his sharp suits, and Basinger, who looks poured into her stylish, curve-hugging gowns, fell in love while shooting this 1991 film. Unfortunately their onscreen chemistry, apart from a couple of simmering bedroom scenes, is anything but combustible.  Neil Simon based his original screenplay on a real-life Hollywood story of l'amour fou, but even in his hands the ping-ponging romance feels contrived. Without that troublesome heat of uncontrollable passion, this amiable comic drama winds up lukewarm. -- Sean Axmaker --Amazon.com",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Shrek the Halls \n Description: Product Description The Christmas tree isn\u2019t the only thing green in this new holiday classic. Shrek is back and trying to get into the spirit of the season. After promising Fiona and the kids a Christmas they\u2019ll remember, he is forced to take a crash course in the holiday. But just when he thinks he has everything for their quiet family Christmas just right, Donkey, Puss in Boots, Gingy and the rest of the gang decide to crash the party. Shrek the Halls is the greatest holiday tale that\u2019s never been told\u2026until now. Amazon.com Despite its 22-minute run time, Shrek the Halls (originally written as a half-hour TV special), is packed with plenty of laughs and holiday cheer. The animation is rich, and the character interplay among all the folks we know and love--Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, Puss in Boots--endearing and spot-on. Shrek wants to throw the \"perfect Christmas\" for Fiona and the kids, but as an ogre, has no Yule experience. So he starts at the local bookstore, where a winsome clerk (voiced by Marissa Jaret Winokur) quickly sizes up Shrek's hapless situation and pronounces: \"I know all about Christmas, and I have just the book for you: 'Christmas for Village Idiots.'\" Shrek becomes so focused on doing the holiday \"by the book\" that he fails to notice the magic and comradely chaos unfolding all around him. Fiona, for instance, has some neat tricks for making holiday decorations (watch how she turns a festively striped snake into the perfect candy cane). The kids are happily frolicking with the kids of Donkey and everyone else in the village--but the commotion is too much for Shrek, who snaps. Will his ogrely hissy fit ruin Christmas--and make him overlook the meaning of Christmas that can't be found in a book? Even viewers who might guess the answer will enjoy the trip, including competing versions of \"A Visit from St. Nicholas,\" better known as \"The Night Before Christmas.\" Puss's version: \"He was dressed all in fur / From his head to his paws / And he stood there heroic, / A real Santa... Claws.\" And the film is full of cute references to holiday classics like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (\"Excuse you for what?\" barks Shrek after one of his kids does a dainty Fiona belch knockoff). Even bit players get big laughs, like the three German pigs, ready to have a Christmas Eve sleepover. One points out to his brothers: \"Look! We are pigs, ja ? Und we are in a blanket, ja ? It's funny, ja ?\" Ja! Warning to parents: There is one scary, almost gruesome scene that involves Santa Claus, but it's over quickly and then the film is back to its funny and heartwarming purpose. Extras include an animated sing-along \"Twelve Days of Christmas\" featurette as well as several holiday games to keep the tykes engaged after the last present is unwrapped. -- A.T. Hurley",

The sheriff becomes involved in the illicit operations, making sure his men and federal agents stay clear of the stills. When a deputy stumbles upon the still and is killed, this makes the sheriff an accomplice to the crime. Amazon.com Definitely not to be confused with 2005's much-honored Walk the Line , director John Frankenheimer's 1970 film I Walk the Line uses the music of Johnny Cash to tell a very different story. Gregory Peck is Henry Tawes, the sheriff of a depressed and depressing rural backwater whose life goes pretty much straight into the outhouse once he lays eyes on Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld), daughter of a local moonshiner. Bored with his job and his home life alike, Tawes may not suffer fools, but he's only too willing to become one once Alma, an irresistible and much younger Tennessee tart (Peck was in his mid-fifties at the time; Weld was nearly three decades behind him), starts pulling his strings at the behest of her pa (Ralph Meeker), who's using his daughter to help, uh, persuade the sheriff to overlook his criminal activities. It's obvious from the git-go that none of this will turn out well for our hero, and while Frankenheimer (who directed the original Manchurian Candidate ) and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (a future Oscar winner for Ordinary People and Julia ) do a decent job of keeping the tension mounting, the film never quite catches fire. Part of that is due to the measured, laconic performance delivered by Peck, who has a certain dignity that keeps him from really inhabiting his role; much more convincing is Charles Durning as his deputy, a donut-eating, law-bending Southern slug. On the other hand, it's always nice to hear Cash delivering the classic title song, even if his several other tunes featured in I Walk the Line fall somewhat short of that standard. --Sam Graham \n rating: 4.0 \n review: excellent-------\nItem title: The Golden Girls: Season 1 \n Item description: Product Description An Emmy Award winner for Outstanding Comedy Series in its very first year, THE GOLDEN GIRLS has become a landmark in television history and an all-time fan favorite. Beatrice Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Estelle Getty star as four South Florida seniors sharing a house, their dreams, and a whole lot of cheesecake. Bright, promiscuous, clueless, and hilarious, these lovely mismatched ladies form the perfect circle of friends. Experience all 25 laugh-packed episodes of Season One in this spectacular 3-disc set, including the series pilot and an exclusive bonus feature that offers a whole new look at the show. It's all the provocative fun and entertainment you remember ... and so much more. Amazon.com Launched during the neon-lit 1980s, The Golden Girls shed light on a side of Miami ignored by Miami Vice . In other words, no drugs, no murder--just four women of \"a certain age,\" spending their golden years in the sun. Like the theme, \"Thank You for Being a Friend,\" the long-running sitcom was about friendship (not crime). As for the \"girls,\" they were tart-tongued Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur), former farm girl Rose (Betty White), Southern belle Blanche (Rue McClanahan), and Dorothy's salty Sicilian mother Sophia (Estelle Getty). All were widows, with the exception of the divorced Dorothy. Created by Emmy-winning producer Susan Harris ( Soap ), The Golden Girls re-ignited the careers of 1970s TV veterans Arthur ( All in the Family , Maude ) and White ( The Mary Tyler Moore Show ). At the same time, it made stars of McClanahan (who co-starred on Maude ), by playing a comic version of A Streetcar Named Desire 's Blanche Dubois, and the scene-stealing Getty, made to look older than her actual age (she and Arthur were born the same year). Notable guests to lend their talents to the first season include Star Trek: Voyager 's Robert Picardo (\"The Operation\"), Alice 's Polly Holliday (\"Blind Ambitions\"), and WKRP in Cincinnati 's Gordon Jump (\"Big Daddy\"). In addition, Harold Gould ( Rhoda ), who appears in \"Rose the Prude,\" would return as a (different) recurring character five years later. The Golden Girls ran for seven seasons and spawned spin-off The Golden Palace (without Arthur) and a British version called The Brighton Belles . By the end of its run in 1992, it had garnered numerous awards, including two Emmys for best comedy series. In addition, each of the four actresses received a well-deserved Emmy for her efforts. --Kathleen C. Fennessy \n rating: 3.0 \n review: very funny-------\nItem title: The Golden Girls: Season 3 \n Item description: Product Description Your favorite young-at-heart women return for another helping of laughter, misadventures, and cheesecake in the third season of one of television's most highly acclaimed sitcoms ever, THE GOLDEN GIRLS. Dorothy, Sophia, Rose, and Blanche are the four mismatched housemates living together in Miami. While these very different women don't always get along, deep down they really love one another. A perennial award winner, this laugh-filled season garnered three Emmy(R) Awards and a Golden Globe(R). Now you can enjoy all 25 episodes from this unforgettable year on this complete DVD set. Included is the original and unedited \"Golden Moments\" episode where the girls reminisce about their times together, plus hilarious bonus features that will have you laughing for hours. It's proof positive that good comedy never grows old. Amazon.com While it might seem like something out of another dimension given the world we're living in now, this prime-time show that aired from 1985 to 1992 about the hilarious exploits of four single women of a certain age living out their semi-retirement in Miami still stands up. The plots are mostly predictable, and the set never changes, but this ensemble cast really comes into its own in the third season--one that earned them three Emmys and a Golden Globe. Blanche is just as man-crazy as ever, Sophia works her brutal honesty and \"picture Sicily stories\" to perfection, Dorothy remains the eternal stalwart straight man without compare, and Rose's dull-witted reveries always make for a great gag. Standout episodes in this season include \"A Letter to Gorbachev,\" where Rose pens a letter urging Gorbachev to end the Cold War with the West; in a terrific dream sequence, she imagines herself addressing a huge crowd in Red Square against a backdrop featuring the faces of Marx, Lenin, and of course, herself. \"The Housekeeper\" tackles stereotypes as the girls hire a Caribbean woman as their new housekeeper and suspect she's put a curse on them. \"Grab That Dough\" sees the girls on a fictional game show where they allow greed and ambition to come between their friendships and predictably, no one wins. \"Three on a Couch\" is one of those convenient midseason flashback episodes, the premise being that the girls are so sick of each other that they try to get professional help to solve their problems; the therapist's frank advice is that they get as far away from each other as possible. Although the season is on the whole is a perfect collection of sharp one-liners, there is depth to this show that isn't afraid to discuss Alzheimer's disease in \"Old Friends,\" or the crushing financial complications of being old and single in \"The Audit.\" Extras include \"Golden Moments,\" a great montage of the funniest lines in the season and \"The Golden Girls Scrapbook\" that comprises each girl's best lines. These two extras could be enough to satisfy any Golden Girls fan, who perhaps doesn't have the time to indulge in all 25 episodes. -- Gabi Knight \n rating: 4.0 \n review: very funny-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I enjoyed watching movies with strong storylines and interesting characters, so I'm looking for something with a compelling plot and memorable characters.

        "input": "Below is the previous historical purchases and reviews of the user:```Item title: I Walk the Line  Item description: Product Description A married backwoods Tennessee sheriff falls in love with a teenager whose father is a moonshiner. The sheriff becomes involved in the illicit operations, making sure his men and federal agents stay clear of the stills. When a deputy stumbles upon the still and is killed, this makes the sheriff an accomplice to the crime. Amazon.com Definitely not to be confused with 2005's much-honored Walk the Line , director John Frankenheimer's 1970 film I Walk the Line uses the music of Johnny Cash to tell a very different story. Gregory Peck is Henry Tawes, the sheriff of a depressed and depressing rural backwater whose life goes pretty much straight into the outhouse once he lays eyes on Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld), daughter of a local moonshiner. Bored with his job and his home life alike, Tawes may not suffer fools, but he's only too willing to become one once Alma, an irresistible and much younger Tennessee tart (Peck was in his mid-fifties at the time; Weld was nearly three decades behind him), starts pulling his strings at the behest of her pa (Ralph Meeker), who's using his daughter to help, uh, persuade the sheriff to overlook his criminal activities. It's obvious from the git-go that none of this will turn out well for our hero, and while Frankenheimer (who directed the original Manchurian Candidate ) and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (a future Oscar winner for Ordinary People and Julia ) do a decent job of keeping the tension mounting, the film never quite catches fire. Part of that is due to the measured, laconic performance delivered by Peck, who has a certain dignity that keeps him from really inhabiting his role; much more convincing is Charles Durning as his deputy, a donut-eating, law-bending Southern slug. On the other hand, it's always nice to hear Cash delivering the classic title song, even if his several other tunes featured in I Walk the Line fall somewhat short of that standard. --Sam Graham  rating: 4.0  review: excellent-------Item title: The Golden Girls: Season 1  Item description: Product Description An Emmy Award winner for Outstanding Comedy Series in its very first year, THE GOLDEN GIRLS has become a landmark in television history and an all-time fan favorite. Beatrice Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Estelle Getty star as four South Florida seniors sharing a house, their dreams, and a whole lot of cheesecake. Bright, promiscuous, clueless, and hilarious, these lovely mismatched ladies form the perfect circle of friends. Experience all 25 laugh-packed episodes of Season One in this spectacular 3-disc set, including the series pilot and an exclusive bonus feature that offers a whole new look at the show. It's all the provocative fun and entertainment you remember ... and so much more. Amazon.com Launched during the neon-lit 1980s, The Golden Girls shed light on a side of Miami ignored by Miami Vice . In other words, no drugs, no murder--just four women of \"a certain age,\" spending their golden years in the sun. Like the theme, \"Thank You for Being a Friend,\" the long-running sitcom was about friendship (not crime). As for the \"girls,\" they were tart-tongued Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur), former farm girl Rose (Betty White), Southern belle Blanche (Rue McClanahan), and Dorothy's salty Sicilian mother Sophia (Estelle Getty). All were widows, with the exception of the divorced Dorothy. Created by Emmy-winning producer Susan Harris ( Soap ), The Golden Girls re-ignited the careers of 1970s TV veterans Arthur ( All in the Family , Maude ) and White ( The Mary Tyler Moore Show ). At the same time, it made stars of McClanahan (who co-starred on Maude ), by playing a comic version of A Streetcar Named Desire 's Blanche Dubois, and the scene-stealing Getty, made to look older than her actual age (she and Arthur were born the same year). Notable guests to lend their talents to the first season include Star Trek: Voyager 's Robert Picardo (\"The Operation\"), Alice 's Polly Holliday (\"Blind Ambitions\"), and WKRP in Cincinnati 's Gordon Jump (\"Big Daddy\"). In addition, Harold Gould ( Rhoda ), who appears in \"Rose the Prude,\" would return as a (different) recurring character five years later. The Golden Girls ran for seven seasons and spawned spin-off The Golden Palace (without Arthur) and a British version called The Brighton Belles . By the end of its run in 1992, it had garnered numerous awards, including two Emmys for best comedy series. In addition, each of the four actresses received a well-deserved Emmy for her efforts. --Kathleen C.

        "ground_truth": "Title: The Artist [DVD] \n Description: Product Description Hollywood 1927. George Valentin (Academy Award Winner Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar. The advent of the talkies will sound the death knell for his career and see him fall into oblivion. For young extra Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), it seems the sky's the limit - major movie stardom awaits. THE ARTIST tells the story of their interlinked destinies. Amazon.com The Artist is a love letter and homage to classic black-and-white silent films. The film is enormously likable and is anchored by a charming performance from Jean Dujardin, as silent movie star George Valentin. In late-1920s Hollywood, as Valentin wonders if the arrival of talking pictures will cause him to fade into oblivion, he makes an intense connection with Peppy Miller, a young dancer set for a big break. As one career declines, another flourishes, and by channeling elements of A Star Is Born and Singing in the Rain , The Artist tells the engaging story with humor, melodrama, romance, and--most importantly--silence. As wonderful as the performances by Dujardin and B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo (Miller) are, the real star of The Artist is cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman. Visually, the film is stunning. Crisp and beautifully contrasted, each frame is so wonderfully constructed that this sweet and unique little movie is transformed from entertaining fluff to a profound cinematic achievement. -- Kira Canny",

The season begins with the introduction a couple new regulars--agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) and assistant medical examiner Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen). And one cast member departs the show by the end of the season. The six-disc set includes all 23 episodes, which aired on CBS during 2004-2005. The show's sophomore year begins with \"See No Evil,\" in which a Navy officer (guest star David Keith) is forced to embezzle millions of dollars, or risk having his wife and blind daughter killed by a kidnapper (played by Tom Cruise's cousin William Mapother). Led by Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), the crack NCIS team comes through to save the day and reveal the mastermind behind the twisted case. Gibbs doesn't display much more emotion this season than he did in the show's debut, but he's just as sarcastic (and even tempered) when being threatened. During one altercation, the mafia threatens to kill his father, brothers and uncles. Non-plussed, Gibbs calmly says that while he has no male relatives still alive, he'd be happy to fax over the numbers of his three ex-wives. With the help of his ace medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum from The Man from U.N.C.L.E ), Gibbs and his team are almost invincible when it comes to solving complicated crimes. Whether he's piecing together the bones of a body, or performing an autopsy on a crisply burnt poodle, Ducky is matter-of-fact as he talks to his dead \"clients.\" Of his nervous but eager assistant Jimmy, Ducky notes, \"He means well, but sometimes I have an overwhelming urge to slap him.\" This season, viewers get to see the romantic (and slightly gross) side of Ducky as he briefly romances a doctor half this age. Also on hand to aid (and annoy) Gibbs are happy-go-lucky Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), former Secret Service agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), and forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), who can solve anything if you say \"please\" and bring her a Big Gulp to sip. Look for a gentle guest appearance by Charles Durning as a Medal of Honor recipient who wants to turn himself in for killing his best friend and fellow comrade during World War II. While the plot twists won't surprise most viewers, the acting, writing, and spirit of the episode leaves the viewer feeling satisfied. --Jae-Ha Kim \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Plays good, arrived fast!-------\nItem title: NCIS: Season 3 \n Item description: Product Description This collection presents the series' third season in it's entirety for a total of 24 episodes.

Working on a daily basis with Shepard initially makes Gibbs wary. Not only is she a former girlfriend, but she also was his underling at one time. Equal parts CSI and JAG , NCIS works primarily because of its quirky cast, which is able to take sometimes regurgitated ideas and rework them into something engagingly watchable. Throughout this season, we will see agents endangered and framed, and one will accidentally kill an undercover detective who may not have been armed.

        "ground_truth": "Title: NCIS: Season 5 \n Description: Product Description Taking viewers behind the sealed doors of the military, NCIS follows the workings of investigators at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Led by the wise Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), a crack investigator with no qualms about bending the rules to find his answers, the team takes on cases involving terrorism, murder, espionage, and international arms smuggling. Gibbs is aided by homicide detective Anthony Dinozzo (Michael Weatherly), forensic scientist Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (Davi McCallum), computer expert Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), and department head Jennifer Shepard (Lauren Holly). This collection presents the series fifth season, including a shocking season finale that is sure to shake up the unit. Star: Mark Harmon, Lauren Holly, David McCallum, Sean Murray, Michael Weatherly, Special Features: Widescreen Format. Audio: 5.1 Surround Stereo English Running Time: 835 minutes. Amazon.com Describing season four of NCIS as \"the season of secrets,\" executive producer Shane Brennan suggests that season five (offered here with 18 episodes, including a two-part finale, on five discs) is \"the season of answers.\" For the most part, that's true--but at season's end, loyal viewers are likely to be thrown for a loop by the death of a major character and a startling set of changes bound to have a profound effect on the show's future. Picking up where the previous year left off, this new batch jumps right in with a continuation of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and company's pursuit of notorious international arms dealer La Grenouille (\"The Frog,\" played by Armand Assante), whom NCIS director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) is particularly keen on taking down--a quest that's complicated by the fact that the bad guy is a CIA asset, and by Agent Anthony DiNozzo's (Michael Weatherly) love affair with La Grenouille's daughter. That storyline, barely touched on thereafter, is resolved in the 14th episode, \"Internal Affairs.\" Meanwhile, the NCIS crew is distracted by an array of other cases, most of them involving murder. Of particular interest are several episodes related to Iraq and the War on Terror: a Naval officer of Syrian descent who's suspected of being an Al Qaeda mole is murdered seconds after Gibbs talks him out of jumping off a building ledge; a Marine who's having a violent bout of post-traumatic stress after returning from the Mideast turns out to be far worse off than that; Medical Examiner Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum) refuses to conduct an autopsy because of the deceased's Muslim beliefs. There's no doubt that NCIS is slick, entertaining prime-time television in every respect: writing, acting, production values, music, and so on. Still, one's appreciation of the show largely depends on the characters' likeability, and that's very much a matter of taste. Gibbs may be a chick magnet, with four former wives and a past relationship with Shepard to prove it, but he's also a taciturn fellow with horrible social skills. DiNozzo's funny and insouciant, but his smugness and incessant razzing of computer nerd Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) soon becomes tiresome, while Shepard is steely and simply unlikeable (the most appealing characters are arguably McCallum's Mallard and Pauley Perrette's mouthy Abby Sciuto, the goth-like forensic expert). Bonus material includes cast and crew commentary on various episodes and a typical assortment of featurettes. --Sam Graham",

        "ground_truth": "Title: The Addams Family - The Complete Series \n Description: Product Description TRT: 1758 MINS. This 9 disc set serves up every episode from the entire run of the sitcom The Addams Family, which was based on the macabre cartoons of Charles Addams, and starred John Astin as the patriarch of the happy if ghoulish title clan. The Addams Family \u2013 Volume One If The Munsters was a traditional family sitcom as reimagined by Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine, The Addams Family is a macabre twist on Father Knows Best. The Munster and Addams clans made their TV debuts in 1964 and lasted two seasons before the networks buried them. The Addamses are now gloriously resurrected in this three-disc set that digs up the series' first 22 episodes (oddly, 12 shy of the complete first season). Inspired by Charles Addams's New Yorker cartoons, The Addams Family is fiendishly funny, with a dead-on cast that indelibly embodies Addams's characters. The Addams Family \u2013 Volume Two Based on the original Goth cartoons by Charles \"Chas\" Addams that ran for decades in the New Yorker magazine, The Addams Family television sitcom portrayed a monster family whose moribund physical appearances were counteracted by each family member's exuberance for passion and adventure. This Volume Two DVD contains twenty-one episodes, including the last of season one and the whole of season two, plus commentaries, and a featurette about the cinematic impact The Addams Family had on American television culture.

Amazon.com The Addams Family \u0096 Volume One If The Munsters was a traditional family sitcom as reimagined by Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine, The Addams Family is a macabre twist on Father Knows Best. The Munster and Addams clans made their TV debuts in 1964 and lasted two seasons before the networks buried them. The Addamses are now gloriously resurrected in this three-disc set that digs up the series' first 22 episodes (oddly, 12 shy of the complete first season). Inspired by Charles Addams's New Yorke r cartoons, The Addams Family is fiendishly funny, with a dead-on cast that indelibly embodies Addams's characters. John Astin brings a demented glee to eccentric, frighteningly wealthy Gomez Addams. Carolyn Jones is bewitching as his pre-goth wife, Morticia, whom the Beatles might have had in mind when they sang, \"Baby's in Black.\" Jackie Coogan is the electrifying Uncle Fester, with Ted Cassidy (who famously took a kick in the groin from Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ) is the monstrous butler Lurch, whose \"You rang?\" entered the pop culture lexicon. The Munster s was family friendly. The Addams Family is more sophisticated and wickedly funny. As Gomez notes at one point, \"There's a touch of madness\" in the Addams household, where \"every day is Halloween.\" Bear rugs growl, a disembodied hand, Thing, delivers the mail, and a torture rack is good for what ails you. The children, Wednesday (Lisa Loring) and older brother Pugsley (Ken Weatherwax), enjoy such hobbies as playing autopsy or exploding model trains. Gomez and Morticia were one of television's most passionate couples, with Gomez being driven to arm-kissing ecstasy whenever Morticia spoke French. The last episode included in this collection, \"Amnesia in the Addams Family,\" is a classic in which Gomez is rendered \"normal\" following a conk on the head. The look of disgust on Morticia and Lurch's face when he asks for a glass of milk is priceless. The \"altogether ooky\" extras include three episode commentaries, a featurette on Charles Addams, reminiscences from cast members Astin, Loring, and Weatherwax, a segment on the creation of the classic snap-snap theme song (\"They're creepy and they're kooky....\"), and the inevitable theme song sing-along. The Addams Family at last on DVD? As Gomez might exclaim: \"Capital!\" -- Donald Liebenson The Addams Family \u0096 Volume Two Based on the original Goth cartoons by Charles \"Chas\" Addams that ran for decades in the New Yorker magazine, The Addams Family television sitcom portrayed a monster family whose moribund physical appearances were counteracted by each family member's exuberance for passion and adventure. This Volume Two DVD contains twenty-one episodes, including the last of season one and the whole of season two, plus commentaries, and a featurette about the cinematic impact The Addams Family had on American television culture. Premiering the same year as The Munsters , this short-lived series was one of the first two shows to take issue with the Leave It To Beaver aesthetic that dominated television throughout the 50s, in which perfect families narrowly defined normality in the American home. Instead, it starred a family feared by neighbors, who within the boundaries of their haunted Victorian mansion invented their own thriving, not to mention fun, culture. The Addams Family proved that outsiders could be extremely gracious, educated, and interesting, even if eccentricities rendered their looks a threat.  These episodes include the original cast: Gomez (John Astin) and Morticia (Carolyn Jones), Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan), the two children Wednesday and Pugley, butler Lurch, hairy Cousin Itt, and the enigmatic hand, Thing, who plays castanets for the married couples' cha cha parties, and looks up things in phone books. Macabre humor in each episode reverses average, expected logic. Flower arranging, for Morticia, involves de-budding and stripping roses of all but the thorns. In \"Morticia, The Sculptress,\" Gomez bribes a local art dealer to buy Morticia's hideous art at the Addams Family's own expense, revealing Gomez to be a strange but loving husband. In most episodes, such as \"Lurch, The Teenage Idol\" and \"Cousin Itt and the Vocational Counselor,\" The Addams' aim to help their loved ones succeed, in these cases Lurch, as a harpsichord-playing pop star, and Itt, on a career search for an unintelligible, hair-covered little person. The Addams Family house interior still looks exquisite forty years later, full of taxidermied animals, antique furniture, carnivorous plants, and medieval charm. One watches this show not only for its sets and costumes, but also for its refreshingly wide take on what successful families can look like. -- Trinie Dalton The Addams Family \u0096 Volume Three Product description: The Addams Family is not your typical family: they take delight in most of the things that \"normal\" people would be terrified of.

Amit Goswami, Ph.D, a pioneer of this revolutionary new perspective within science shares with us his vision of the unlimited potential of consciousness as the ground of all being, and how this revelation can actually help us to live better. The Quantum Activist tells the story of a man who challenges us to rethink our very notions of existence and reality, with a force and scope not felt since Einstein. This film bridges the gap between God and Science. The work of Goswami, with stunning precision and without straying from the rigors of quantum mechanics, reveals the overarching unity inherent in the worlds major religions and mystical traditions. Meet the man behind the message as Dr. Goswami tells how he moved away from the religious teachings of his childhood, to seek his path in nuclear and theoretical quantum physics, and how he has come full circle, through quantum insight, back to the very religious axioms offered as a youth. With a poignant relevance to the problems of our day this film follows Dr. Goswami as he demonstrates how our mistaken views of reality have led to our current environmental, social, economic and spiritual crisis; as well as the means of correcting these errors.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Black Whole \n Description: Product Description Black Whole uncovers scientific proof that we are one. The work of physicist, Nassim Haramein, provides insight into the structure of space-time and a new coherent model of the universe. Using the sacred geometry and codes in ancient monuments and documents, the film presents a new look at the reality of which we live. About the Actor As early as 9 years old, Nassim was already developing the basis for a unified hyperdimensional theory of matter and energy, which he eventually called the \"Holofractographic Universe.\"Nassim has spent most of his life researching the fundamental geometry of hyperspace, studying a variety of fields from theoretical physics, cosmology, quantum mechanics, biology and chemistry to anthropology and ancient civilizations. Combining this knowledge with a keen observation of the behavior of nature, he discovered a specific geometric array that he found to be fundamental to creation, and the foundation for his Unified Field Theory emerged.This unification theory, known as the Haramein-Rauscher metric (a new solution to Einstein's Field Equations that incorporates torque and Coriolis effects) and his most recent paper The Schwarzschild Proton, lays down the foundation of what could be a fundamental change in our current understandings of physics and consciousness. This groundbreaking theory has now been delivered to the scientific community through peer-reviewed papers and presentations at international physics conferences. Further, The Schwarzschild Proton paper has recently received the prestigious \"Best Paper Award\" in the field of physics, quantum mechanics, relativity, field theory, and gravitation at the University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium during the 9th International Conference CASYS'09.Fluent in both French and English, Mr. Haramein has been giving lectures and seminars on his unification theory for over 10 years. His lectures are multimedia presentations that lead his audiences through the validity of his theories with observational and theoretical data. He has presented at such institutions as the Department of Physics at Georgia Tech, the Department of Physics at University of Nebraska at Omaha, and Fellows of the Department of Education at the University of Montreal, and his unification model has now been delivered to the American Physical Society.In addition to his scientific papers, Mr. Haramein imparts this theory in a layman's paper, a 4 DVD set entitled \"Crossing the Event Horizon: Rise to the Equation,\" and his international speaking tours.In the past 20 years, Mr. Haramein has directed research teams of physicists, electrical engineers, mathematicians and other scientists. He has founded a non-profit organization, the Resonance Project Foundation, where, as the Director of Research, he continues exploring unification principles and their implications in our world today. The foundation is actively developing a research park on the island of Hawai'i where science, sustainability, and green technology come together.",

Algeria in the 1930s is an intersection of Jewish, Arab and French culture. A cat belonging to a widowed rabbi and his beautiful daughter eats the family parrot and miraculously gains the ability to speak. Along with the power of speech comes unparalleled sardonic wit, and the cat spares no group or individual as it skewers faith, tradition and authority in a provocative exploration of God, death, lust and the search for truth. Rich with the colors, textures, flavors and music of Mediterranean Africa, the film embarks on a cross-continent comedic adventure through colonial Algiers and under vast Saharan skies in search of a lost Ethiopian city. *In French with English Subtitles* Special Features Bonus Documentary on the Filmmaker: Joann Sfar Draws From Memory; Making Of Featurette; U.S. Trailer Bonus Documentary on the Filmmaker: Joann Sfar Draws From Memory; Making Of Featurette; U.S. Trailer Review Endearingly loopy\u2026lush! --The New York TimesGrade: A.

It's the incredible true story of one of the world's most fascinating leaders -- Tibet's Dali Lama and his daring struggle to rule a nation at one of the most challenging times in its history. Powerfully told and set against a backdrop of world politics -- the film's release created an international uproar! Featuring a striking Oscar(R)-nominated score by renowned composer Philip Glass, this extraordinary motion picture has been greeted with both controversy and worldwide acclaim -- experience it for yourself! Amazon.com It would be a mistake to call Kundun a disappointment, or a film that director Martin Scorsese was not equipped to create. Both statements may be true to some viewers, but they ignore the higher purpose of Scorsese's artistic intention and take away from a film that is by any definition unique. In chronicling the life of the 14th Dalai Lama, Kundun defies conventional narrative in favor of an episodic approach, presenting a sequential flow of events from the life of the young leader of Buddhist Tibet. From the moment he is recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 to his exile from Tibet in the wake of China's invasion, the Dalai Lama is seen as an enlightened spiritual figurehead. This gives the film its tone of serenity and reverence but denies us the privilege of admiring the Dalai Lama as a fascinating human character. There's a sense of mild detachment between the film and its audience, but its visual richness offers ample compensation. In close collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins, Scorsese filmed Kundun with great pageantry and ritual, and meticulous attention to details of costume, color, and the casting of actual Buddhist monks in the scenes at the Dalai Lama's palace. Certain images will linger in the memory for a long time, such as the Dalai Lama's nightmarish vision of standing among hundreds of dead monks, their lives sacrificed in pacifist defiance of Chinese aggression. Is this a film you'll want to watch repeatedly? Perhaps not. But as a political drama and an elegant gesture of devotion, Kundun is a film of great value and inspirational beauty--one, after all, that perhaps only Scorsese could have made. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Poignant telling of Tibet and the young Dalai Lama's struggle against an aggressive communist China.

The characters of David and his father have a bizarre and twisted relationship, a strange understanding of their motivations and reasons for becoming killers. Then there's the twist of several famous horror actors who traditionally play villains in the roles of heroes, you keep expecting some of them to make a sudden turn to being on the side of the serial killer, but they are not just there for camp factor.-------\nItem title: Knights of Bloodsteel \n Item description: In the faraway land of Mirabilis, the warlord Dragon-Eye has unleashed his terrifying forces to hunt down the source of all power, a legendary Crucible.

Stills from Knights of Bloodsteel (Click for larger image) \n rating: 4.0 \n review: While I have to say the film is in no way a great epic; it does provide for an insteresting world that sadly didn't get explored. The world of Humans, Elves, and Goblins living together due to their dependence upon the substance of blood-steel drew me in (Perhaps its the gamer...more correctly game-master in me that likes to see a good setting with lots of background). Though Christopher Loyd does make for an odd choice as an elf!<br />Most of the goblin make up was pretty interesting, but the main villain (Dragon Eye)looks good right up until he speaks or moves. They could have done a lot better...it didn't need to be as over the top; it would have moved better on his face if they had toned it down a bit (or even just shaded it a bit better).<br />The plot is predictable; but I found it engaging.<br />Don't look for big-budget production values, but for the budget they had I feel they did well.-------\nItem title: Baphomet [Blu-ray] \n Item description: BAPHOMET tells the tale of an American family (the Richardsons) celebrating their daughter's pregnancy, but things begin to go awry when Satanic cult leader, Henrik Brandr unexpectedly visits their ranch. Henrik offers to pay the family a large sum for ownership of their land, claiming it is sacred to his congregation. Jacob Richardson, the father, rejects the offer due to the sentimental value of his ranch. Henrik, displeased, begins to put curses on the Richardsons, trying to force them off of their own land - even if it means murdering them. After suffering unexplainable tragedies created by the curses, the Richardsons seek help from Marybeth, a white witch high priestess. They soon discover a terrible secret about their house, revealing why their land is so scared to the cult. They realize that they must protect their house from the cult at all costs, and a violent battle between good and evil ensues \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Confession time, I am a fan of Matthan Harris' first film: The Inflicted/Bundy Reborn...that said I was following a lot of teasers about this film as it was being produced, that said I was really looking forward to seeing this one.<br />First let me point out that this is an indie film, completely so, a labor of love, not a slick and cgi filled production, don't go into it expecting this to be a major hollywood film.<br /><br />Those things said, here's the meat of the review.<br />This film is much faster paced than The Inflicted, I was kind of expecting a similar pace and was pleasantly surprised (in fact its a compliment to say I couldn't really multi task while watching this film because it moved along quickly). IT was more action focused than the first film as well. The production values and acting was also improved over his first film.  The cult portrayed had a rather 80s satanic feel and look (at least to start with), the family was portrayed in a way that made me feel for them more than I do with a lot of horror films (never have connected to the partying teen protagonist types, lol). The occultism was glossed over a bit, but that was not intended to be the focus of the story rather than the family being under siege by evil.<br />The effects were pretty good, including some pretty good editing for the shark attack scene, and the resulting corpse (I remember seeing the spoiler photos of the model corpse). I particularly liked the way they portrayed a descent into hell and the resurrection of the same character.-------\nItem title: Maneater Triple Feature 6: Grizzly Rage / Hybrid / Hellhounds \n Item description: Grizzly Rage: A road trip for four high -school buddies celebrating their graduation turns into a lesson in survival when they accidentally hit a bear cub and suffer the wrath of the avenging mother Grizzly. What unfolds is a long dark night of stark raging fear as they face off against the wilds of nature. Hybrid: When a young man is blinded in an explosion, he becomes the first human subject to undergo a cross-species transplant. Receiving the eyes of a wolf, he can now see in the dark. Unfortunately, he also starts seeing other humans as prey. Ordered to be hunted down and destroyed, he seeks shelter with a mysterious museum curator a half-breed female herself, determined to protect him. Hellhounds: A Greek warrior must travel to the Underworld and battle killer hellhounds in order to rescue his murdered bride from the clutches of Hades. \n rating: 3.0 \n review: I knew what I was getting into when I bought it...you don't go buying a three pack of any sci-fi (sorry SyFy) movies without knowing you're getting a set of b-movies...<br />Hybrid was the most interesting of the three, with it's blending of typical werewolf story and mystical experiences, I liked that one a lot.<br />Hellhounds was the one I was more interested in initially, it's more fantasy than horror/sci-fi. The Hellhounds of the title are barely in it, and quite frankly not as important as the sword & sorcery theme of a descent into the underworld to rescue a lost love while dealing with treachery and jealousy. Nothing spectacular, but not a bad bit of fantasy fiction.<br />Grizzly Rage was, to be frank, just stupid and bad. It is the worst stereotype of the carefree kids do something stupid, get in trouble, and do more stupid things repeatedly while being stalked by a grizzly bear who does very few things the way an actual bear would.-------\nItem title: Bitten \n Item description: Jack is a night-shift paramedic who rescues a troubled young woman from the throes of death. When he brings Danika home to mend, he discovers she\u2019s a vampire in need of a nightly fix. Otherwise, she\u2019s really perfect. But as the victims pile up, Jack questions his own fate, and what his growing fear of commitment could cost him. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I wasn't expecting much from the movie at first, but I found it be at once extremely funny yet filled with moments of true horror (something you don't find in a lot of 'horror' movies these days). While the bulk of the plot is predictable, it is still very enjoyable. If you don't like Jason Mewes' typical characters, all I can say is he's a bit more toned down in this one.-------\nItem title: Fire & Ice - Dragon Chronicles \n Item description: When the peaceful kingdom of Carpia is besieged by a monstrous Fire Dragon, Princess Luisa (Amy Acker) searches for a savior to slay the mighty beast. She finds Gabriel (Tom Wisdom), the son of a legendary knight, and the two summon the powerful Ice Dragon, a decision which may prove deadly for them all. BONUS FEATURE:Making-of featurette. \n rating: 3.0 \n review: If I have anything really good to say about Fire & Ice-Dragon Chronicles it's that the dragons were very imaginative and break out of the typical dinosaur with wings style many use as the basis for a dragon. They are more like reptilian/elemental manta rays flying through the air. For the most part the action and story focuses on the people and the kingdoms affected by the first dragon and much of THAT part of the story is fairly stereotypical (though there were a few good twists).-------\nItem title: TERRY PRATCHETT: GOING POSTAL \n Item description: A tale of love and revenge \u2026 and stamps \u201cElaborately designed fantasy fun\u201d \u2014 The Observer (U.K.) Moist von Lipwig (Richard Coyle, Lorna Doone ) is a con man and a charlatan\u2014and he loves every minute of it. From confidence tricks to far-reaching financial fraud, von Lipwig revels in hoodwinking, fleecing, and otherwise ripping off the citizens of Ankh-Morpork. When the law finally catches up to him, the city\u2019s shrewd leader, Lord Vetinari (Charles Dance, Game of Thrones ), offers von Lipwig a choice: he can take over the derelict post office . . . or suffer a painful death. The reluctant postmaster finds himself in charge of thousands of undelivered letters, commanding a charmingly deranged staff of misfits, and at odds with corrupt businessman Reacher Gilt (David Suchet, Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot ), who will stop at nothing to crush his competition. Along the way, he falls under the spell of the icy Adora Dearheart (Claire Foy, Little Dorri t), much to her chagrin. In this delightful adaptation of Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novel, Moist von Lipwig needs every ounce of his considerable charm and cunning to restore the post office, trounce Gilt, and win Adora\u2019s affections. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: While there will always be nit-picking to be done when a book as complex and wonderful as Going Postal becomes a movie, this film is still wonderful. The visual interpretation of the clacks, it's mechanisms, and it's workers is dead on.<br />The only real problem I had with it was the character of Reacher Gilt was oversimplified and kind of dumbed-down compared to the character in the book.-------\nItem title: Bundy Reborn \n Item description: David is a troubled medical student who kidnaps, assaults and murders women. After his latest victim, Melissa, becomes pregnant, he attempts to start a family with her as part of a twisted fantasy. When the police rescue Melissa from his warehouse before he can finish his plans, David goes on a rampage to get his new family back. Starring horror icons Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and Doug Bradley. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: First: this is a revamping/retitled version of The Inflicted, which is a film I love for a lot of reasons  (some of which will appear in this review because they remain great reasons).<br />In terms of quality, the overall remastering is great, the effect makes the lighting look much better.<br />Much of the edited scenes are far improved, just tiny cuts and additions that help it flow much better, and clarify a few details. (Good examples are David's own nightmare sequence, the copycat sequences, and the warehouse flashbacks)<br />As for the story and overall film; first up a reminder this is not a studio film, this was a labor of love, and it shows if you're willing to see it.<br />There are some great horror moments and good twists...the best being Matthan's recruitment of some big time horror actors and putting them in totally against the grain roles, the closest exception of Bill Mosely (who is a far more mild mannered killer than his typical fare, lol). The late Sid Haig as a kindly doctor is fantastic, I kept expecting the trope of him suddenly turning out to be maniac but no, he was perhaps the best beacon of goodness in the story.<br />The only thing I am not crazy about is the rename, while Bundy was certainly a predator of women, David's motivations seem far more interesting than just predatory.  So the cover picture and the new name just kind of strike me as a bit off...though I can understand those changes as the inflicted may have made people think it was a film about a crazy disease.-------\nItem title: The Maid \n Item description: During the Seventh month on the Chinese calendar, the gate of hell open and the dead rise to walk the earth. There are rules people must follow for 30 days in order to survive. Never swim, never turn back at night when you hear someone call and never talk to strangers on a deserted road. Break any of the rules and you face the haunting consequences. Rosa (Alessandra Di Rossi) a young woman from the Phillipines arrives in Singapore to work as a domestic maid. Naive and innocent she has never believed in the supernatural and ultimately breaks the rules of the seventh month one by one. Now she will pay a terrible price for her ignorance, \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I had borrowed this movie from a friend a long time ago and was pleased to find an inexpensive copy here on Amazon! While the initial plot twist is relatively easy to predict, those that follow are not! In addition the presentation of the ghosts is wonderful.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, I'm in the mood for something with mythical beasts and epic quests, do you have any recommendations?\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

When the law finally catches up to him, the city\u2019s shrewd leader, Lord Vetinari (Charles Dance, Game of Thrones ), offers von Lipwig a choice: he can take over the derelict post office . . . or suffer a painful death. The reluctant postmaster finds himself in charge of thousands of undelivered letters, commanding a charmingly deranged staff of misfits, and at odds with corrupt businessman Reacher Gilt (David Suchet, Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot ), who will stop at nothing to crush his competition. Along the way, he falls under the spell of the icy Adora Dearheart (Claire Foy, Little Dorri t), much to her chagrin. In this delightful adaptation of Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novel, Moist von Lipwig needs every ounce of his considerable charm and cunning to restore the post office, trounce Gilt, and win Adora\u2019s affections.  rating: 5.0  review: While there will always be nit-picking to be done when a book as complex and wonderful as Going Postal becomes a movie, this film is still wonderful. The visual interpretation of the clacks, it's mechanisms, and it's workers is dead on.<br />The only real problem I had with it was the character of Reacher Gilt was oversimplified and kind of dumbed-down compared to the character in the book.-------Item title: Bundy Reborn  Item description: David is a troubled medical student who kidnaps, assaults and murders women. After his latest victim, Melissa, becomes pregnant, he attempts to start a family with her as part of a twisted fantasy. When the police rescue Melissa from his warehouse before he can finish his plans, David goes on a rampage to get his new family back. Starring horror icons Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and Doug Bradley.  rating: 5.0  review: First: this is a revamping/retitled version of The Inflicted, which is a film I love for a lot of reasons  (some of which will appear in this review because they remain great reasons).<br />In terms of quality, the overall remastering is great, the effect makes the lighting look much better.<br />Much of the edited scenes are far improved, just tiny cuts and additions that help it flow much better, and clarify a few details. (Good examples are David's own nightmare sequence, the copycat sequences, and the warehouse flashbacks)<br />As for the story and overall film; first up a reminder this is not a studio film, this was a labor of love, and it shows if you're willing to see it.<br />There are some great horror moments and good twists...the best being Matthan's recruitment of some big time horror actors and putting them in totally against the grain roles, the closest exception of Bill Mosely (who is a far more mild mannered killer than his typical fare, lol). The late Sid Haig as a kindly doctor is fantastic, I kept expecting the trope of him suddenly turning out to be maniac but no, he was perhaps the best beacon of goodness in the story.<br />The only thing I am not crazy about is the rename, while Bundy was certainly a predator of women, David's motivations seem far more interesting than just predatory.  So the cover picture and the new name just kind of strike me as a bit off...though I can understand those changes as the inflicted may have made people think it was a film about a crazy disease.-------Item title: The Maid  Item description: During the Seventh month on the Chinese calendar, the gate of hell open and the dead rise to walk the earth. There are rules people must follow for 30 days in order to survive. Never swim, never turn back at night when you hear someone call and never talk to strangers on a deserted road. Break any of the rules and you face the haunting consequences. Rosa (Alessandra Di Rossi) a young woman from the Phillipines arrives in Singapore to work as a domestic maid. Naive and innocent she has never believed in the supernatural and ultimately breaks the rules of the seventh month one by one. Now she will pay a terrible price for her ignorance,  rating: 4.0  review: I had borrowed this movie from a friend a long time ago and was pleased to find an inexpensive copy here on Amazon! While the initial plot twist is relatively easy to predict, those that follow are not! In addition the presentation of the ghosts is wonderful.-------```And here is the user's intention: Hey, I'm in the mood for something with mythical beasts and epic quests, do you have any recommendations?Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Kiss the Girls \n Description: Product description The lone escapee of a serial kidnapper is determined to rescue the fellow captives she left behind in this race-against-time suspense. Genre: Suspense Rating: R Release Date: 12-DEC-2003 Media Type: DVD Amazon.com Coming after The Silence of the Lambs and Seven , this thriller about a collaboration between two serial killers feels like a pale attempt to cash in on the success of those earlier, better films. That's a pity, because this film certainly has its strengths--particularly in the central performances of Morgan Freeman as a forensic detective and Ashley Judd as a would-be victim who escaped from one of the killers. Director Gary Fleder demonstrates visual flair and maintains an involving undercurrent of tension, but as this adaptation of James Patterson's novel approaches its climax, familiar elements combine to form a chronic case of thriller d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It's altogether competent filmmaking in the service of a moribund story of competing psychopaths, and by the time the serial killers reach the home stretch of their twisted contest, the movie's dangerously close to Freddy Kruger territory, with a finale that could've been borrowed from any dozen similar thrillers. --Jeff Shannon",

Now, with the magic spell broken, these amazing Gargoyles awaken from their slumber to find themselves transported from the moors of Scotland to the bustling metropolis of New York City. Follow each suspenseful episode to find out if this proud clan of winged warriors will seek revenge on the race that betrayed them. Amazon.com Since its 1994 debut, Disney's animated series Gargoyles has attracted a sophisticated viewership for its unusually thoughtful storyline, mature characters, literary allusions (Arthurian lore, Shakespeare), and parade of celebrity voiceovers. Part Gothic fantasy and part contemporary urban drama, Gargoyles begins with a brutal, 10th-century battle over a Scottish castle, which is guarded at night by winged gargoyles who become flesh in the dark (but who return to stone by day). Under the leadership of Goliath (Keith David), the gargoyles ward off an attack by Vikings, yet are met with disdain by those they protect, including a princess and her advisors. Such is the gargoyles' lot until they are betrayed by a friend and turned to stone for a thousand years.

With a certain urgency in every episode, tangled relationships between Goliath and his several allies and enemies (as well as characters who belong somewhere between), and a vocal cast full of Star Trek types (Michael Dorn, Nichelle Nichols, Marina Sirtis, among others), Gargoyles has great appeal to thinking viewers of any age.

The movie gets off to a kicky start as Nichols joins a big-city band, meets his future wife (Barbara Bel Geddes), and sits in on a speakeasy session with Louis Armstrong. Armstrong's in the movie a lot, and there are smaller roles for other musical names such as Bob Crosby and Ray Anthony.

It also proved Kaye could handle melodrama at least as easily as frantic comedy, and yet this 1959 film was near the end of his run as a movie actor.

The suspense builds in Season 2 as archenemy Demona unleashes a plot to turn the entire population of New York into statues, and flashbacks reveal even more of the history of these legendary figures. Enjoy the first 26 episodes of the second season of GARGOYLES in this special 3-disc DVD set complete with hours of exclusive, fan-requested bonus features. Amazon.com A little more complicated but no less intelligent than the first season, the animated Gargoyles: Season 2, Volume 1 follows the further adventures of the ancient Scots clan of gargoyles relocated to modern Manhattan and freed from a curse that had turned them to stone. Still sworn to protect their new, adopted city while dealing with the underhanded, sometimes criminal machinations of the man who lifted the curse--billionaire Xanatos (voice by Jonathan Frakes)--gargoyles leader Goliath (Keith David) and his fellow misfits cope with consequences of some very modern problems (genetic engineering, pirate television) as well as some from the days of magic (time travel, evil spells). In the 26 episodes in this boxed set (half the content of season 2), Xanatos is particularly busy cooking up mischief--some of which goes very wrong, such as the forced metamorphosis of several kidnapped humans into winged monsters, an experiment conducted by one of the mad scientists working in his labs. A couple of multi-part stories, such as \"City of Stone,\" in which New York's inhabitants are turned to stone under a dark spell, and \"Avalon,\" in which Goliath ventures into King Arthur territory, enrich and anchor season 2 with consistent storylines. As with the first season, these new tales have an impressive vocal cast, including Michael Dorn, Tim Curry, David Warner, and Sheena Easton. --Tom Keogh",

Jason Segel, Academy Award(R) nominee Amy Adams (Best Performance By An Actress In a Supporting Role, Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter ) and Academy Award winner Chris Cooper (Best Performance By An Actor In A Supporting Role, Adaptation ) join everyone's favorite Muppets and an all-star celebrity cast in a comic adventure for the whole family. While on vacation in Los Angeles, Walter, the world's biggest Muppet fan, his brother Gary, and friend Mary uncover the diabolical plot of a greedy oil millionaire to destroy the Muppet Theater. Now, the Muppet-loving trio must reunite Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and their friends to stage the greatest Muppet telethon ever and save their beloved theater. The gang is back together again in a must-own movie full of irresistible music and family fun. Bring home the biggest Muppet adventure ever on Disney Blu-ray(TM) and DVD! Amazon.com Movies attempting to retrieve cherished nuggets of pop culture often stumble, either by appealing solely to the die-hard minutia enthusiasts or clunking up the batter with unnecessary additions to the base material. (Enough with the human love triangles, get to the giant robots fighting.) Thankfully, this revival of Jim Henson's beloved characters gets the formula delightfully right, providing a googly-eyed nostalgia trip for adults while also retaining the original's sense of bright (and mildly subversive) wonder. All that's missing is a cameo from Shields and Yarnell, really. Kicking off with a boffo musical number, the story follows Walter (voice of Peter Linz), a small-town boy with a uniquely personal affection for the long-retired Muppets. (OK, he's made of felt.) Teaming up with his brother (Jason Segel, who also co-scripted) and the local schoolteacher (Amy Adams), they attempt to get Kermit, Fozzie, and the gang back together in order to save their studio from an evil oil baron (Chris Cooper, going all in). Director James Bobin ( Flight of the Conchords ) does a marvelous job of updating and honoring his material, weaving sly references to days gone by (the contents of Kermit's rolodex are a particular delight) into the mix of songs, celebrity cameos, and barn-broad puns that gave the original show its bubbly kick. (Fans of Animal and the Chickens will not go home disappointed.) Even the moments that don't quite work land with a cornball brio that feels wholly of a piece with Henson's universe.

        "input": "Below is the previous historical purchases and reviews of the user:```Item title: The Muppets  Item description: Product Description Muppet domination continues with a hilarious new movie from Walt Disney Studios. Jason Segel, Academy Award(R) nominee Amy Adams (Best Performance By An Actress In a Supporting Role, Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter ) and Academy Award winner Chris Cooper (Best Performance By An Actor In A Supporting Role, Adaptation ) join everyone's favorite Muppets and an all-star celebrity cast in a comic adventure for the whole family. While on vacation in Los Angeles, Walter, the world's biggest Muppet fan, his brother Gary, and friend Mary uncover the diabolical plot of a greedy oil millionaire to destroy the Muppet Theater. Now, the Muppet-loving trio must reunite Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and their friends to stage the greatest Muppet telethon ever and save their beloved theater. The gang is back together again in a must-own movie full of irresistible music and family fun. Bring home the biggest Muppet adventure ever on Disney Blu-ray(TM) and DVD! Amazon.com Movies attempting to retrieve cherished nuggets of pop culture often stumble, either by appealing solely to the die-hard minutia enthusiasts or clunking up the batter with unnecessary additions to the base material. (Enough with the human love triangles, get to the giant robots fighting.) Thankfully, this revival of Jim Henson's beloved characters gets the formula delightfully right, providing a googly-eyed nostalgia trip for adults while also retaining the original's sense of bright (and mildly subversive) wonder. All that's missing is a cameo from Shields and Yarnell, really. Kicking off with a boffo musical number, the story follows Walter (voice of Peter Linz), a small-town boy with a uniquely personal affection for the long-retired Muppets. (OK, he's made of felt.) Teaming up with his brother (Jason Segel, who also co-scripted) and the local schoolteacher (Amy Adams), they attempt to get Kermit, Fozzie, and the gang back together in order to save their studio from an evil oil baron (Chris Cooper, going all in). Director James Bobin ( Flight of the Conchords ) does a marvelous job of updating and honoring his material, weaving sly references to days gone by (the contents of Kermit's rolodex are a particular delight) into the mix of songs, celebrity cameos, and barn-broad puns that gave the original show its bubbly kick. (Fans of Animal and the Chickens will not go home disappointed.) Even the moments that don't quite work land with a cornball brio that feels wholly of a piece with Henson's universe. The result is a true family movie that still brings on the blissful, uncomplicated grins days after viewing. No matter what Statler and/or Waldorf might say, the show goes on. --Andrew Wright Related Products Versions of The Muppets on Blu-ray and DVD  rating: 5.0  review: muppets are the best!-------```And here is the user's intention: I really enjoy movies with great music, likable characters, and a magical storyline, so I'm looking for something similar in my next watch!Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Frozen \n Description: Product Description Fearless optimist Anna teams up with Kristoff in an epic journey, encountering Everest-like conditions, and a hilarious snowman named Olaf in a race to find Anna's sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. Amazon.com A sweet, magical film filled with great music, likable characters, and striking effects, Frozen is a fairy tale about overcoming obstacles and the power of true love. Princesses Anna and Elsa are sisters and the closest friends until one day Elsa discovers that she can no longer control her power to create ice and snow. Terrified for the safety of her sister and everyone around her, Elsa isolates herself and vows to never feel any sort of passionate emotion again in hopes of suppressing her powers. But when Elsa comes of age and is set to be crowned queen, she must open the gates of the palace and let in the public, not to mention her sister Anna. Things go horribly wrong and Anna pursues her sister into the mountains in an attempt to save Elsa and reverse the deep freeze that Elsa has inadvertently released on the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, Anna joins forces with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), an ice seller with a strangely close relationship with his reindeer Sven, and Olaf (Josh Gad), a goofy snowman whom she suddenly remembers from early childhood. In the end, Anna and Elsa discover that only by embracing their deepest feelings do they have a chance of saving themselves and the kingdom. Inspired by \"The Snow Queen\" story by Hans Christian Andersen, the film has plenty of quirky, lovable characters along with a nice blend of corny humor, serious sentiment, suspense, and peril. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel deliver rousing performances of great music that includes original songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez and an original score by Christophe Beck, and the visual effects are simply stunning. Frozen definitely succeeds in captivating audiences young, old, and every age in between. --Tami Horiuchi",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Lost - The Complete Second Season \n Description: Product Description 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Push the button and prepare to be blown away by the groundbreaking television event USA Today calls \"TV's best series.\" The multiple Emmy(R) Award-winning drama reaches new heights in its spectacular second season as the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 discover they are not alone in their battle against \"the Others,\" and a contested decision to open the hatch reveals a new realm of mystery and intrigue. Prepare yourself for the experience of Season Two, complete with over 8 hours of original bonus material you can't see anywhere else -- including unaired original flashbacks -- and you'll discover for yourself why \"everything happens for a reason.\" Amazon.com What was in the Hatch? The cliffhanger from season one of Lost was answered in its opening sequences, only to launch into more questions as the season progressed. That's right: Just when you say \"Ohhhhh,\" there comes another \"What?\" Thankfully, the show's producers sprinkle answers like tasty morsels throughout the season, ending with a whopper: What caused Oceanic Air Flight 815 to crash in the first place? As the show digs into more revelations about its inhabitant's pasts, it also devotes a good chunk to new characters (Hey, it's an island; you never know who you're going to run into.) First, there are the \"Tailies,\" passengers from the back end of the plane who crashed on the other side of the island. Among them are the wise, God-fearing ex-drug lord Mr. Eko (standout Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); devoted husband Bernard (Sam Anderson); psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros, whose character has more than one hidden link to the other islanders); and ex-cop Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), by far the most infuriating character on the show, despite how much the writers tried to incur sympathy with her flashback. Then there are the Others, first introduced when they kidnapped Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) at the end of season one. Brutal and calculating, their agenda only became more complex when one of them (played creepily by Michael Emerson) was held hostage in the hatch and, quite handily, plays mind games on everyone's already frayed nerves. The original cast continues to battle their own skeletons, most notably Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Michael (Harold Perrineau), whose obsession with finding Walt takes a dangerous turn. The love triangle between Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway), which had stalled with Sawyer's departure, heats up again in the second half. Despite the bloating cast size (knocked down by a few by season's end) Lost still does what it does best: explores the psyche of people, about whom \"my life is an open book\" never applies, and cracks into the social dynamics of strangers thrust into Lord of the Flies-esque situations. Is it all a science experiment? A dream? A supernatural pocket in the universe? Likely, any theory will wind up on shaky ground by the season's conclusion. But hey, that's the fun of it. This show was made for DVD, and you can pause and slow-frame to your heart's content. Just try and keep that head-spinning to a minimum. On the DVD Commentaries by various cast members and producers reveal little other than the occasional easter egg (the Dharma logo on the shark fin, Walt's mumbling translating to \"Don't push the button; the button is bad\" backwards). But disc seven opens with an eerie Hanso Foundation instructional video, leading you to eight hours of bonus features, including cast members' own theories, deleted scenes, and featurettes on specific episodes. It's all well and good for Lost fanatics, but if you want the cream of the crop, check out: \"Lost Connections,\" an interactive feature that reveals how all the islanders are actually linked (for instance, one of the officers who captured Sayid during the Gulf War is Kate's father); a Channel UK promo for the show directed by David LaChappelle in which cast members suck in their cheeks and, dressed in evening wear, tango in slow motion as if in a Calvin Klein ad (it has to be a joke, right?); and \"The World According to Sawyer,\" which strings together each of the un-PC nicknames and pop culture references spewed by Holloway's character. Favorites include \"Chewie\" for Jin and \"Ponce de Leon\" for Ana Lucia. It's by far the cherry on top of a sweet dessert. -- Ellen A. Kim",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead \n Description: Product Description TWO MINOR CHARACTERS FROM THE PLAY, 'HAMLET' STUMBLE AROUND UNAWARE OF THEIR SCRIPTED LIVES AND UNABLE TO DEVIATE FROM THEM. Amazon.com Tom Stoppard's modern stage classic finds a pair of film actors worthy of its verbal japery and existential bewilderment: Gary Oldman and Tim Roth are deliciously locked in as the title characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead . And yet it remains difficult to tell which one is Rosencrantz and which Guildenstern--even they seem unsure--a clever part of Stoppard's ingenious design. Focusing on a pair of unremarkable characters from Hamlet , Stoppard sees the great play from their confused perspective. Now and again the action of Hamlet sweeps them up, but most of the time R&G are left wondering where they are, what they have been sent for, and why they can't remember anything that happened before the beginning of the play. Richard Dreyfuss (fittingly grandiloquent) is the Player King, who seems to know more about the ominous workings of fiction and tragedy than the heroes do. Stoppard's first outing as a film director is handsomely shot but uncertainly paced--although any time Oldman and Roth go into one of their tennis-match debates on probability, identity, or death, the movie crackles. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern may be the \"indifferent children of the earth,\" but for this brief moment they deserve center stage. --Robert Horton",

For those of you who have no idea what Invader Zim is, this a very inexpensive way to find out. And I might add, worth every penny. You get the ENTIRE series in six wonderful CDS. This show is guaranteed to make you laugh. Jhonen Vasquez's imagination, though creepy at times, is absolutely incredible. The show provides a fresh and slightly more mature style of comedy that will keep you laughing for hours.

The set contains five DVDs, (one more than the regular special edition) production designs and production stills, a movement cell, a \"Spinner\" replica, and an origami unicorn replica. Everything is topped off with a signed plastic letter by the director, Ridley Scott. On top of that, there are only a limited supply of suit cases (designed after Harrison Ford's in the film) and each one has it's own identification number on the bottom, unique to each case.<br />Seem like overkill?<br />Well, let's talk a little bit about the film itself. The story revolves around a special policeman/bounty hunter (Blade Runner Unit), who has been assigned to eliminate 4 murderous androids who have made it back to earth from an off-world colony. The androids, known as replicants, have only a certain amount of time to live; for their specific model 4 years. However, as we progress through the story, we begin to see the desperate goal of the replicants: to obtain more life. The plot writhes around different concepts of what make us human, and of course, what doesn't.<br />The original release of the film contained a narration that many believe to have been a bad choice. The ending is happier, and the scenes are shortened.<br />The directors cut, released some time later, contained a different (better) ending, no narration, and lengthened scenes.<br />The final cut, released this year, takes the directors cut, and makes it the definitive vision of Ridley Scott. For those worried that it will be too much, don't worry. It's not a whole lot different, however, it has some extending scenes that are worth seeing. Be warned however, this version is rather gruesome.<br />Overall, this package is remarkable. For the price you will pay, it is more than worth it. It even includes the extremely rare rough cut of the film, and a never-before seen documentary and deleted or alternate scenes. For anyone who loves this movie as much as I do, this is a must have.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, I really enjoy movies with intriguing plots and strong performances, so I'm looking for something that will keep me captivated and provide a unique experience.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Morituri \n Description: Product Description An Allied agent tries to disarm scuttling explosives aboard a German captain's rubber ship. Amazon.com Marlon Brando plays a world-weary, conscientious objector to all wars in the tense, thoughtful Morituri , an adult drama about wartime ethics and the price of commitment to a cause. Brando plays Robert Crain, a German deserter who escaped the Nazis with his fortune intact, happy to be sitting out the battle in British-governed India. His comfort is challenged when an intelligence official (Trevor Howard) essentially blackmails him into going undercover, posing as an SS officer taking passage on a German ship carrying tons of rubber for munitions. Crain's mission is to deliver the ship into Allied hands, but once he's aboard, he becomes a target of derision by the proud, anti-Nazi captain (Yul Brynner) and suspicion by a handful of Resistance members planning to scuttle the voyage. The dramatic irony in this film by German actor-director Bernhard Wicki is that Crain, who claims to take no sides and believes in nothing worth killing for, becomes a catalyst for a great deal of sacrifice and the underscoring of others' convictions with bloodshed. Janet Margolin has a memorable role as a half-mad, Jewish doctor who puts her life on the line to help Crain, and Brynner nearly steals the show in a tremendous performance as a man who has lost faith in everything. Some spectacular scenes give Morituri a certain electricity, including a complicated, unbroken shot taken (one presumes) from a helicopter that swoops in on the ship from a distance to catch a few lines of dialogue and a bit of action. --Tom Keogh",

        "ground_truth": "Title: The List \n Description: Product Description Renny Jacobson is shaken by the news of his father's mysterious death and mystified by the reference in his will to an obscure entity called \"The Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.\" He sets out on a quest to learn the truth about \"The List\" and finds that he must fulfill a prophecy spoken in 1863 or risk losing the true treasure that has changed his life. Amazon.com The List , a supernatural thriller, begins at the close of the Civil War, when a cabal of Southern businessmen formed a secret pact to preserve their personal wealth. A century and a half later, a frustrated young lawyer named Renny Jacobsen (Chuck Carrington, JAG ) discovers he's been cut out of his estranged father's will--but when he opens a locked box, he discovers a far more complicated inheritance that leads him to meet an attractive woman named Jo Johnston (Hilarie Burton, One Tree Hill ) and the charming but mephistophelean Desmond Larochette (played by the charming but mephistophelean Malcolm McDowell), who leads the descendants of the original cabal. As Jacobsen learns how his history is tied up in this ominous list of names, he finds himself torn between his morals and his craving for money. Based on the Christian novel by Robert Whitlow, The List does its best to make the most of a low budget, focusing on character and story rather than special effects or visual style. Ultimately it's more about the power of prayer than being scary, though McDowell does his best to foster a sinister atmosphere. While Christian viewers may find the ending affirming, nonbelievers may find it a bit anticlimactic. -- Bret Fetzer Beyond The List on DVD Watch Once on DVD Check out an old favorite, The Princess Bride on DVD Catch up on Stargate Atlantis on DVD Stills from The List (Click for larger image)",

For newly-promoted Detective Inspector George Bennett (Lee Ingleby), his first missing persons case his first chance to prove himself to his new bosses ultimately launched a superstar career.

REMEMBER THE TITANS is a rousing celebration of how a town torn apart by resentment, friction, and mistrust comes together in triumphant harmony. The year is 1971. After leading his team to 15 winning seasons, football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is demoted and replaced by Herman Boone (Washington), tough, opinionated, and as different from the beloved Yoast as he could be. How these two men overcome their differences and turn a group of hostile young men into champions, plays out in a remarkable and triumphant story full of soul and spirit. You and your family will never forget the Titans. Amazon.com With only one major star (Denzel Washington), an appealing cast of fresh unknowns, and a winning emphasis of substance over self-indulgent style, Boaz Yakin's Remember the Titans is, like Rudy before it, a football movie that will be fondly remembered by anyone who sees it. Set in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971, the fact-based story begins with the integration of black and white students at T. C. Williams High School. This effort to improve race relations is most keenly felt on the school's football team, the Titans, and bigoted tempers flare when a black head coach (Washington) is appointed and his victorious predecessor (Will Patton) reluctantly stays on as his assistant. It's affirmative action at its most potentially volatile, complicated by the mandate that the coach will be fired if he loses a single game in the Titans' 13-game season. The players represent a hotbed of racial tension, but as the team struggles toward unity and gridiron glory, Remember the Titans builds on several subplots and character dynamics to become an inspirational drama of Rocky -like proportions. Yakin--whose debut, Fresh , was one of the best independent films of the 1990s--understands the value of connecting small scenes to form a rich climactic payoff. Likewise, Washington provides a solid dramatic foundation (his coach is obsessively harsh, but for all the right reasons) while giving his younger co-stars ample time in the spotlight. The result is a film that achieves what it celebrates: an enriching sense of unity that's unquestionably genuine.

Bissinger, Friday Night Lights looks at high school football in the harsh light of reality, finding heart and hardness while stirring our emotions. Actor-director Peter Berg ( Very Bad Things, The Rundown ) is Bissinger's cousin; he knows the material well, and understands how an obsession with winning turns high school kids into somber, over-pressured gladiators--expendable soldiers in a community war against shame and obscurity. The fact-based story focuses on the 1988 football season of Odessa-Permian high school in West Texas, and as a fast-paced sports movie, Berg delivers the goods with a rousing, frenetically styled crowd-pleaser. But there's darkness in this tale of weary underdogs, including an abusive father (well-played by country music star Tim McGraw), threatening townsfolk, an injured star running back (Derek Luke), a tormented quarterback (Lucas Black), and the melancholy coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who takes his team to the finals. Berg's film could use less flashy cutting and more drama to support its gridiron intensity, but Friday Night Lights offers a refreshing alternative to the conventional sports movie, and makes a perfect triple-feature with the equally exciting documentaries Go Tigers! and The Last Game . --Jeff Shannon",

However, as a consequence, he never learned to show them affection and treats his boys little better than the hired help. Joe (Robert Wagner), is Matt's son by Native American wife Se\u00f1ora (Katy Jurado). Because of Joe's mixed ethnicity, he is treated prejudicially by his three half-brothers, Ben (Richard Widmark), Mike (Hugh O'Brian), and Danny (Earl Holliman) - all Caucasian sons of Matt's first wife. Joe loves his father and would do nearly anything for him, but his siblings resent Matt's emotional distance. When Matt discovers a nearby copper mine is polluting a stream where he waters his cattle, he becomes furious and leads a raid on the mine that causes the law to visit the ranch; the police have a warrant to arrest whoever was responsible for the attack. To spare his father the agony and humiliation of a stay behind bars, Joe claims responsibility and spends several years in prison. When he's released, he discovers that Ben and his other brothers rebelled against their father with such extremity that the old man suffered a fatal stroke. While Se\u00f1ora tries to persuade Joe not to seek revenge, Ben is more than willing to fight his brother for taking his father's side. ...Broken Lance \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Terrific westernhih again demonstrates how underrated Robert Wagner has been as an actor. Of course he has a splendid actor to guide him this time in Spencer Tracy.<br />But I want to again commend 20th Century Fox for doing a superb restoration of another of their 1950s-60s CinemaScope movies.

Sophia Loren\u2019s First English language starring role and while the idea of her falling for middle aged shorty Alan Ladd is silly, it doesn\u2019t matter much as the movie belongs to her, and Greece.

Set (Gerard Butler), the merciless god of darkness, has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict. With only a handful of heroic rebels opposing Set's savage rule, Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a bold and defiant mortal, enlists the aid of the powerful god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an unlikely alliance against the evil overlord. As their breathtaking battle against Set and his henchmen takes them into the afterlife and across the heavens, both god and mortal must pass tests of courage and sacrifice if they hope to prevail in the spectacular final confrontation. \n rating: 3.0 \n review: A movie that has many weaknesses but is hugely enjoyable all the same. Spectacular effects and it whips along, so ignore the bad press and let it wash over you.-------\nItem title: An Actor's Revenge (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray] \n Item description: A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier, An Actor's Revenge is an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life.BLU-RAY EDITION FEATURES- New 4K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack - Rare 1999 Directors Guild of Japan interview with director Kon Ichikawa, conducted by critic and filmmaker Yuki Mori- New interview with critic, filmmaker, and festival programmer Tony Rayns- New English subtitle translation- PLUS: An essay by critic Michael Sragow \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I cannot wait to see this wonderful, totally original and captivating movie On Blu Ray.

Of course he has a splendid actor to guide him this time in Spencer Tracy.<br />But I want to again commend 20th Century Fox for doing a superb restoration of another of their 1950s-60s CinemaScope movies. I live in the UK and had to buy this from Spain as it is not released in the UK or the US! Why? He colours are gorgeous, sparkling in its wide screen original format. Not a blemish, dirt or tear anywhere! Wonderful. More please Fox.-------Item title: Boy on a Dolphin (1957)  Item description: Off a Greek coastal island, a beautiful sponge diver (Sophia Loren) discovered a fabulous golden statue within a sunken galleon. She shares her find with a visiting American archeologist (Alan Ladd), who implores her to donate it to a museum... but when her grasping boyfriend allies with an unscrupulous art dealer (Clifton Webb), a perilous race to recover the ship's treasures is on. Long-sought adventure, Loren's English-language debut, also stars Jorge Mistral, Laurence Naismith; Jean Negulesco directs. 111 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: English Dolby Digital mono; theatrical trailers.  rating: 4.0  review: Beautiful restoration by Fox of this glorious travelogue wrapped around a story of treasure hunting in the Greek Islands. Sophia Loren\u2019s First English language starring role and while the idea of her falling for middle aged shorty Alan Ladd is silly, it doesn\u2019t matter much as the movie belongs to her, and Greece. Sophia is glorious. Clifton Webb is his usual slippery charming self adding to the fun.-------Item title: Gods Of Egypt  Item description: Magic, monsters, gods, and madness reign throughout the palaces and pyramids of the lush Nile River Valley in this sweeping action-adventure inspired by the classic mythology of Egypt. With the survival of mankind hanging in the balance, an unexpected hero undertakes a thrilling journey to save the world and rescue his true love. Set (Gerard Butler), the merciless god of darkness, has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict. With only a handful of heroic rebels opposing Set's savage rule, Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a bold and defiant mortal, enlists the aid of the powerful god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an unlikely alliance against the evil overlord. As their breathtaking battle against Set and his henchmen takes them into the afterlife and across the heavens, both god and mortal must pass tests of courage and sacrifice if they hope to prevail in the spectacular final confrontation.  rating: 3.0  review: A movie that has many weaknesses but is hugely enjoyable all the same. Spectacular effects and it whips along, so ignore the bad press and let it wash over you.-------Item title: An Actor's Revenge (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]  Item description: A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier, An Actor's Revenge is an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life.BLU-RAY EDITION FEATURES- New 4K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack - Rare 1999 Directors Guild of Japan interview with director Kon Ichikawa, conducted by critic and filmmaker Yuki Mori- New interview with critic, filmmaker, and festival programmer Tony Rayns- New English subtitle translation- PLUS: An essay by critic Michael Sragow  rating: 5.0  review: I cannot wait to see this wonderful, totally original and captivating movie On Blu Ray. My rating is for the movie as I\u2019ve yet to see what Criterion releases, but as I have never been disappointed by any of their releases, I\u2019m sure my rating will not change.-------```And here is the user's intention: I enjoy classic movies with a touch of nostalgia, so I would appreciate a recommendation for a film that embodies the essence of a bygone era.Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

The music track features traditional choral arrangements of classic Christmas songs like \"White Christmas\" and \"Silver Bells\" with full instrumental accompaniment. A similar DVD, Fireplace: Visions of Tranquility , differs by offering multiple perspectives on a fire from ignition to the last dying embers and featuring all-instrumental Christmas carols performed in a baroque style as well as non-holiday-specific classical music.

I have been to 2 X-files panels at Comic Con and have been a die hard fan since the show aired. I was looking forward to owning this on day 1 and was disappointed to receive the wrong product. Furthermore,  they have no satisfactory solution for me. Buyer beware, buy somewhere else!-------```And here is the user's intention: I love watching classic TV shows and childhood favorites, so I'm always looking for new series to dive into - recommend me something nostalgic and entertaining like my previous picks!Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Iris (Winslet) is in love with a man who is about to marry another woman. Across the globe, Amanda (Diaz), realizes the man she lives with has been unfaithful. Two women who have never met and live 6000 miles apart, find themselves in the exact same place. They meet online at a home exchange website and impulsively switch homes for the holiday. Iris moves into Amanda's L.A. house in sunny California as Amanda arrives in the snow covered English countryside. Shortly after arriving at their destinations, both women find the last thing either wants or expects: a new romance. Amanda is charmed by Iris' handsome brother Graham (Law) and Iris, with inspiration provided by legendary screenwriter Arthur (Wallach), mends her heart when she meets film composer Miles (Black). Amazon.com As a pleasant dose of holiday cheer, The Holiday is a lovable love story with all the Christmas trimmings. In the capable hands of writer-director Nancy Meyers (making her first romantic comedy since Something's Gotta Give ), it all begins when two successful yet unhappy women connect through a home-swapping website, and decide to trade houses for the Christmas holiday in a mutual effort to forget their man troubles. Iris (Kate Winslet) is a London-based journalist who lives in a picture-postcard cottage in Surrey, and Amanda (Cameron Diaz) owns a movie-trailer production company (leading her to cutely imagine most of her life as a \"coming attraction\") and lives in a posh mansion in Beverly Hills. Iris is heartbroken from unrequited love with a cad of a colleague (Rufus Sewell), and Amanda has just broken up with her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns), so their home-swapping offers mutual downtime to reassess their love lives. This being a Nancy Meyers movie (where everything is fabulously decorated and romantic wish-fulfillment is virtually guaranteed), Amanda hooks up with Iris's charming brother Graham (Jude Law), and Iris is unexpectedly smitten with Miles (Jack Black), a super-nice film composer on the downside of a failing relationship. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I love it, it is a romantic refreshing movie, well performed, I enjoyed it.-------\nItem title: Out on a Limb aka Minhas Vidas (TV Movie) (2pcs) [Import] \n Item description: This is a Region 0(All) DVD and it will play on any DVD players sold in the US or Canada. It will play also on any DVD players worldwide that plays NTSC format.   Audio in English. Optional Subtitles in Portuguese.   Actress Shirley MacLaine plays herself in this adaptation of her book \"Out on a Limb,\" which chronicles her numerous earthly and metaphysical experiences. The telefilm dramatizes MacLaine's romances (including an affair with a married man), her close encounters with extraterrestrials and her out-of-body experiences. Other subjects explored include reincarnation, ESP, trances and karma, all of which played important roles in the actress's rather unique life. It begins on a California beach, and climaxes on a peak in Peru, where Shirley MacLaine finds her past, her present and perhaps her future. Rebounding from an affair with a British politician and drawn to a mysterious teacher, Shirley starts a spiritual journey that leads her around the world and beyond. Film Notes: Aired originally on the ABC Television Network January 18 and 19, 1987.   If you enjoy metaphysical films, then you'll love this one which covers the following topics and more: synchronicities, karma, metaphysics, reincarnation, Edgar Cayce, Pleiadians, soul groups, spirit guides, akashic records, out of body experiences, co-creators, channeling, extraterrestrials, innerterrestrials, past lives, spiritual paths, nazca lines and UFOs \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I had a VHS version, I'm glad I could get it in DVD.-------\nItem title: And So It Goes \n Item description: There are a million reasons not to like realtor Oren Little (Michael Douglas), and that's just the way he likes it.

Clueless about how to care for a sweet, abandoned nine-year-old, he pawns her off on his determined and lovable neighbor Leah (Diane Keaton) and tries to resume his life uninterrupted. But little by little, Oren stubbornly learns to open his heart - to his family, to Leah, and to life itself - in this uplifting comedy from acclaimed director Rob Reiner. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Such a sweet and romantic movie, at a late age two people falling in love is so true and excellent performance for those two great actors such as Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton.
