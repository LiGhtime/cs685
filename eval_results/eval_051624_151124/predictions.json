When Adam Thornton (Asner) learns that he is terminally ill, his estranged wife (Stapleton) insists that he spend one last Christmas with his now-adult children. Adam agrees--but insists that they not know of his illness. Now, in an idyllic, snow-covered New England town, the Thornton family tries to find reunion before it is too late. ]]> Amazon.com A fondly remembered holiday item from the latter phase of a great age of TV movies, The Gathering has an irresistible idea and a splendid central performance from Edward Asner, the actor for whom the term gruff but lovable was surely coined. We learn in the opening seconds of the film that Asner's character, a well-to-do businessman named Adam Thornton, has been diagnosed with a terminal illness; he's got three months left, at best. Time to make amends, and Adam reaches out to his ex-wife (Maureen Stapleton) and his mostly estranged kids for a final Christmas gathering. You won't find many surprises along the way, but the script by veteran screenwriter James Poe takes time for the small things, and gives Asner a believably conflicted character to play. It's directed by Randal Kleiser, who was just a year away from jumping to a big-screen career and scoring a smash with Grease . There's also some interest in watching a batch of young actors in the early stages of their careers: Bruce Davison, Gregory Harrison, Veronica Hamel, and Stephanie Zimbalist are in the Thornton extended family. If The Gathering has the basic look and feel of a TV movie (with wintry location work in Ohio), it nevertheless creates an honest, earned glow as it sorts through one man's final accounting of what has mattered in his life. --Robert Horton \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This version is an OFFICIAL release by MGM studios with closed captioning.<br /><br />Yes the movie looks a little dated, the clothes, the cars, etc...but that's just the external stuff.<br /><br />The story itself is timeless.<br /><br />It's nice to finally have on dvd with captions.

Amazon.com A sweet, magical film filled with great music, likable characters, and striking effects, Frozen is a fairy tale about overcoming obstacles and the power of true love. Princesses Anna and Elsa are sisters and the closest friends until one day Elsa discovers that she can no longer control her power to create ice and snow. Terrified for the safety of her sister and everyone around her, Elsa isolates herself and vows to never feel any sort of passionate emotion again in hopes of suppressing her powers. But when Elsa comes of age and is set to be crowned queen, she must open the gates of the palace and let in the public, not to mention her sister Anna. Things go horribly wrong and Anna pursues her sister into the mountains in an attempt to save Elsa and reverse the deep freeze that Elsa has inadvertently released on the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, Anna joins forces with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), an ice seller with a strangely close relationship with his reindeer Sven, and Olaf (Josh Gad), a goofy snowman whom she suddenly remembers from early childhood. In the end, Anna and Elsa discover that only by embracing their deepest feelings do they have a chance of saving themselves and the kingdom. Inspired by \"The Snow Queen\" story by Hans Christian Andersen, the film has plenty of quirky, lovable characters along with a nice blend of corny humor, serious sentiment, suspense, and peril. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel deliver rousing performances of great music that includes original songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez and an original score by Christophe Beck, and the visual effects are simply stunning. Frozen definitely succeeds in captivating audiences young, old, and every age in between. --Tami Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: It is a great movie.

He talks his friend Russell (Harold Ramis) into enlisting with him. Where else, they figure, can they help save the world for democracy and meet girls!

Constantly picking each other apart and holding on to petty slights for decades, Freddie and Stuart are always at each other's throats, cracking snide remarks aimed at the other's age, appearance and flaws. However, underneath their vicious, co-dependent fighting, they have a deep love for one another. Freddie and Stuart are often joined by feisty best friend Violet (Frances de la Tour, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) and Ash (Iwan Rheon, Game of Thrones), their young, upstairs neighbor.

The video is clear and the color is sharp.  I read some reviews about the sound but it just needs to be played at a higher volume but otherwise clear.  The stories hold up despite the age of the series.  I've read all the books so I'm a fan anyway.  Robert Urich is perfect as Spenser.

Constantly picking each other apart and holding on to petty slights for decades, Freddie and Stuart are always at each other's throats, cracking snide remarks aimed at the other's age, appearance and flaws. However, underneath their vicious, co-dependent fighting, they have a deep love for one another. Freddie and Stuart are often joined by feisty best friend Violet (Frances de la Tour, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) and Ash (Iwan Rheon, Game of Thrones), their young, upstairs neighbor. Review \"This sitcom is simply infectious\u2026\" --Entertainment Weekly\"\u2026characters who manage the tightrope between human warmth and on-screen viciousness\u2026\" --The A.V. Club \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Second season better than the first.  Looking forward to the third.-------\nItem title: Miss Marple: The Complete Collection \n Item description: Miss Marple: The Complete Collection (DVD) ]]> \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I own the first release of these episodes and loved them but....  the new release is bright, clear, sounds great.  The best part is my favorite Caribbean Mystery has had more footage restored to it making the story make more sense.  Not sure why it was chopped but if you only bought this new remastered set for that it would be worth it.-------\nItem title: Spenser for Hire Complete Series Seasons 1-3 (DVD) \n Item description:  \n rating: 5.0 \n review: These are excellent DVD's.  The video is clear and the color is sharp.  I read some reviews about the sound but it just needs to be played at a higher volume but otherwise clear.  The stories hold up despite the age of the series.  I've read all the books so I'm a fan anyway.  Robert Urich is perfect as Spenser.  What a shame such a handsome and talented man died too early in life.-------\nItem title: Vicious: The Finale \n Item description: Vicious: The Finale DVD Vicious returns for an hour-long special series finale, charting a year in the life of our beloved characters. Freddie (Ian McKellen) and Stuart (Derek Jacobi) enjoy their inheritance and a birthday; Violet (Frances de la Tour) moves on from her divorce and Ash (Iwan Rheon) arrives with news. Vicious is back for one final hurrah, and it's as ferociously funny and heartfelt as ever. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great ending to a well done series.-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

The creators, producers, participants, and distributors of this program do not assume liability for injury or loss in connection with this exercise program and instructions therein. Amazon.com Get bored easily? Then Prevention's Personal Training with Chris Freytag is one for your collection. There is a whole menu of different workouts that can be mixed and matched, depending on your goal (lose weight, overall toning, specific body-part toning, etc.), your time available, and your mood.

More advanced exercisers can add on any of several chunks of toning, sculpting, and cardio. The moves are, in general, rather basic--squats, lunges, quick-moving reps in the cardio routines, etc., but those of us who weren't born to be in the Rockettes appreciate the simpler choreography. You'll need light hand weights (or slightly heavier for more of a challenge) and a workout mat or thick carpet that floor work. The \"legs & butt workout\" will, if you focus, really make itself felt the next day, and that's a great thing. Freytag is, as usual, an approachable and inspiring fitness leader.

I think that more fitness DVDs should go this route so that you can change it up.  It kind of allows you to have a larger variety with one DVD.<br /><br />I like to use this DVD when I don't have a lot of time to work out.  If I only have 30 min. I can fit it in and it works well.  However, with so few reps, I increased the weights that I use.-------\nItem title: Fat Free Yoga - Lose Weight & Feel Great w/ Ana Brett & Ravi Singh NOW W/THE **MATRIX** \n Item description: Product Description NOW WITH THE ALL NEW DESIGN YOUR OWN WORKOUT MATRIX MENU OPTION Experience Kundalini Yoga's sophisticated approach to effortless conditioning.

I'd been sticking to other workout types because the other hatha yoga dvds I had bought were either boring or weren't challenging me enough.  I bought thid DVD a little while back because I was so stressed out I thought I'd give yoga another try - and this DVD had really good reviews.<br /><br />I love this DVD.  I love the simplicity of it (no cheesy beach and/or pagoda backdrop).  I love how not only are the moves explicity explained, but how we're also told WHY each move is done and what the significance is.  I really feel this practice is effective and powerful and truly allows me to work through not only some physical aspects, but mental aspects as well.  In fact, when I got to the deep relaxation part the first time I did the DVD, I actually cried a little.<br /><br />I really recommend this DVD to anyone interested in expanding or even beginning a yoga practice.  (Don't worry newbies - this practice does not put you into intimidating pretzely type twists).<br /><br />The fighting fire with fire set is my favorite on it.-------\nItem title: The Tracy Anderson Method Mat Workout DVD \n Item description: box and shrink wrap may have ware... \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I love at home work out DVDs.  I'm not one for gyms as I like to be able to work out whenever I have the time to squeeze it in - whether it be while something is cooking in the oven, late at night, whatever.  I thought I'd give this one a try since I saw that it was highly reccommended (and the Madonna/Gwyneth Paltrow endorsement didn't hurt either).<br /><br />I really like this routine a lot. Why?<br />Great music - most workout DVDs are filled with the cheesiest music that I just have to tolerate.  This music is really good - so good that I wished there was a listing of what was used included in the DVD so that I could seek out the artists and download the tunes! That has NEVER happened to me before on a workout DVD.<br />Friendly and likeable instructor - there are some fitness gurus that I just can't stand because watching them and hearing them is unbearable.  Tracy Anderson is calm, soothing, and sweet.<br />Doesn't need a lot of space - I wish I would have had this when I lived in an apartment. Not only does it not take a lot of space, but since you aren't jumping around or anything you wouldn't disturb downstair neighbors.<br />Effective routine - the routine really challenges my muscles to the point of fatigue.  She doesn't move on too soon to the next thing.  I really feel my muscles work.  And the best part is that the moves themselves are not hard to master.  The moves are actually all pretty basic - it is just the exhaustion of the muscles that really makes it work.<br />No real extra \"materials\" needed - Do you have a chair?  Do you have light weights or at least something you can sub as light weights (water bottles)?  Then you're set to go.  She has a mat, but the mat really isn't necessary.<br />Length - To me this DVD is the perfect length. It isn't too long to where I get bored and feel I'm using excess time I don't have.  Nor is it too short where I feel like I'm not doing enough.  Great balance of time.<br /><br />My only complaint I really have with this DVD is that I wish Tracy would talk just a bit more - specifically when she changes moves on the floor ab part.  Because she doesn't audibly say she's starting something new with each move or side, I have to physically try to watch the TV while doing these.  I'm assuming that's not the most efficient/best way to do it since usually I like to focus on the ceiling or something to keep my form in check.  If I'm turning to the side to see what she's doing, then I'm not really focusing on what I am doing.-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

She has a mat, but the mat really isn't necessary.<br />Length - To me this DVD is the perfect length. It isn't too long to where I get bored and feel I'm using excess time I don't have.  Nor is it too short where I feel like I'm not doing enough.  Great balance of time.<br /><br />My only complaint I really have with this DVD is that I wish Tracy would talk just a bit more - specifically when she changes moves on the floor ab part.  Because she doesn't audibly say she's starting something new with each move or side, I have to physically try to watch the TV while doing these.  I'm assuming that's not the most efficient/best way to do it since usually I like to focus on the ceiling or something to keep my form in check.  If I'm turning to the side to see what she's doing, then I'm not really focusing on what I am doing.-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

Papi (voiced by George Lopez), an amusing Chihuahua who's crazy about Chloe, springs into action and heads south of the border to rescue her, while Chloe gets help from Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), her newfound friend and self-appointed protector. BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA from Walt Disney Pictures is a heartwarming and outrageously funny tale proving once again that good things do come in small packages. It's a real treat for the whole family. Amazon.com Beverly Hills Chihuahua finds director Raja Gosnell back on the talking-dog beat (following his live-action Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleased ), this time in an ambitious, tongue-in-cheek comedy with a fun cast of onscreen and vocal actors. Piper Perabo plays Rachel, niece of a Beverly Hills eccentric (Jamie Lee Curtis) who spends much of her fortune pampering Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore), a spoiled Chihuahua used to pacing through this world with booties on her paws. Chloe gets dog-napped while Rachel takes a vacation in Mexico, and finds protection from a misfit German Shepherd named Delgado (Andy Garcia), who has a painful secret in his past. The two get into and out of a lot of scrapes, trying to stay ahead of a vicious dog (Edward James Olmos) working for the head of an illegal dogfight gambling syndicate. Computer effects turn the film's many four-legged characters into talking critters capable of leaping onto train boxcars and leading the heroine into the Indiana Jones -like ancestral home of the chihuahua breed.

Forced to confront a powerful demonic entity, the Warrens find themselves caught in the most terrifying case of their lives. Oscar\u00ae nominee Vera Farmiga (The Departed) and Golden Globe nominee Patrick Wilson (Insidious) play the investigators while Golden Globe nominee Ron Livingston (Band of Brothers) and Emmy\u00ae nominee Lili Taylor (Six Feet Under) play the Perron family plagued by sinister spirits in this dark chiller from the writers of The Reaping and the creator of the Saw films. ]]> Amazon.com Director James Wan made a splash in the horror genre with Saw , a rather ingenious midnight movie that spawned a legion of splattery imitators. Rather than continue in that overtly grody mode, however, Wan chose to move on, with a series of films (most notably Dead Silence and Insidious ) that showed a healthy appreciation of the classics in the field, as well as a gratifying progression of skills behind the camera. The Conjuring stands as the moment when Wan puts it all together, fashioning a terrifically freaky haunted-house movie that respects its audience, even when it's busy finding new ways to launch them out of their seats. Based on ostensibly true events, the film works as something of a thesis on scary movies, featuring all of the essential elements--a creaky door here, a scary doll there, dark corners, well, everywhere--as well as a command of old-school pacing. Unlike the majority of in-your-face modern horror, it knows when to hold back, and when to go for absolute broke. Chad and Carey Hayes's script follows Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), a pair of married paranormal investigators dealing with the increasing mental toll of their profession. When they take on the case of a haunted Connecticut farmhouse, their misgivings come to a terrifying head. And then some. Wan gets some fantastic performances from his cast, particularly from the alternately steely and fragile Farmiga, and Lili Taylor, whose inspired work here more than compensates for her appearance in the misguided remake of The Haunting . Together, they make it unnervingly easy to believe in the things in the shadows. The most impressive element of The Conjuring , though, ultimately proves to be its utter relentlessness, steadily cranking the screws without resorting to easy jump scares to tone down the tension. While always playing fair, it qualifies as one of those rare scary movies that put the viewer through the absolute wringer, without leaving them feeling ill-used at the end.

In many ways, HBO's Deadwood embraces the Western's unambiguous morality during the cinema's silent era through the 1930s while also blazing trails through a post- NYPD Blue , post- The West Wing television age exalting dense and customized dialogue. On top of that, Deadwood has managed an original look and texture for a familiar genre: gritty, chaotic, and surging with both dark and hopeful energy. Yet the show's creator, erstwhile NYPD Blue head writer David Milch, never ridicules or condescends to his more grasping, futile characters or overstates the virtues of his heroic ones. Set in an ungoverned stretch of South Dakota soon after the 1876 Custer massacre, Deadwood concerns a lawless, evolving town attracting fortune-seekers, drifters, tyrants, and burned-out adventurers searching for a card game and a place to die. Others, particularly women trapped in prostitution, sundry do-gooders, and hangers-on have nowhere else to go. Into this pool of aspiration and nightmare arrive former Montana lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes), determined to open a lucrative hardware business. Over time, their paths cross with a weary but still formidable Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his doting companion, the coarse angel Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert); an aristocratic, drug-addicted widow (Molly Parker) trying to salvage a gold mining claim; and a despondent hooker (Paula Malcomson) who cares, briefly, for an orphaned girl. Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years. Each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus others. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I likeed Deadwood very much.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Friday Night Lights: The Complete Series \n Description: Product Description When they struggled, we held our breath. When they lost, we felt their pain. And when they won, we cheered them on again and again. Through five extraordinary seasons, the residents of Dillon, Texas, kept viewers captivated with the small-town struggles, victories, and heartbreaks that resonated across America with breathtaking realness, and made Friday Night Lights, a Primetime Emmy\u00ae award-winning drama, one of the best dramas ever to air on TV. Now, relive the spirit of this small town with a big heart: from the pride and pitfalls of high school football to the intimate relationships between lovers, parents and friends. Every moment of this critically acclaimed dramatic series is featured in this incredible collection that includes 19 discs packaged in a beautiful book filled with striking photography from the series. Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton and an all-star ensemble shine in this American drama series that will never be forgotten. Texas forever Review Season 1: The first season of Friday Night Lights accomplishes something that few television dramas are able to do: It betters the 2004 film (starring Billy Bob Thornton) on which the series is based. Set in Dillon, Texas, where football--even on the high school level--is everything, Friday Night Lights is a compelling drama with a football subplot. Poignantly and effectively touching on racism, rape, steroids, jealousy, infidelity, and life-changing injuries, the series presents the inhabitants of Dillon as real people who are flawed, but remarkable in their ordinariness. Though the series struggled to find an audience during its inaugural year, it was a critical favorite thanks to some fine acting by leads Kyle Chandler (as Coach Eric Taylor) and Connie Britton (who portrays his wife, Tami). Coach Taylor's career depends on his ability to get the Dillon Panthers to the state championship. If the team suffers a losing streak, he knows his family, which includes daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden), will no longer be welcome in Dillon. Britton, who also played the coach's wife in the film version, is a phenomenal actress who shares simmering chemistry with Chandler. Not content at just being the coach's wife, she lands a job as a counselor at the local high school. That position plays a pivotal role in the season finale, which leaves viewers wondering whether Eric will leave Dillon to accept a coveted coaching job with a university. Though the majority of the twentysomething actors appear too mature to portray high school students, they have the mannerisms of teens down pat. Gaius Charles is perfect as cocky running back Brian \"Smash\" Williams, who'll risk his health to make sure he gets a football scholarship to college. Local sweethearts Jason Street (Scott Porter) and Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly) are the high school's golden couple. When a football injury leaves him paralyzed, he finds strength in what the future holds for him, but Lyla finds herself in a short-lived affair with Jason's best friend Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch). Once the relationship comes out in the open, their classmates' reactions to the \"traitors\" show that sexual inequality is rampant even in the teen set. Tim's teammates briefly ostracize him, but just as quickly forgive him, especially since he's so valuable on the football field. But Lyla becomes persona non grata to the girls at school who take too much glee in calling the head cheerleader a slut. The hits she takes verbally are no less lethal than the ones the boys take on the gridiron. And the tentative relationship between Julie Taylor and Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford) is the best depiction of teenage love since Angela Chase fell for Jordan Catalano on My So-Called Life. The actors do a wonderful job conveying the sweetness, pain, and hurt of falling in love without really understanding all of its implications. Peter Berg, who co-wrote and co-directed the film, has a strong presence as a writer on the series and evenly distributes the storylines between the kids and the adults. Friday Night Lights is a drama with teenage characters at its core. But the stories are universal. --Jae-Ha KimSeason 2: Friday Night Lights is deeply entrenched in the world of football and teamwork, but the series transcends sports and delves into rich, human relationships that at times are heartbreakingly real. A compelling drama, the show also features one of the strongest (and best looking) ensemble casts. The second season fulfills the promise of its debut. Full of drama, heart, and superb acting, the series is set in fictional Dillon, Texas--a town where everyone lives and breathes football. The first season had Coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) accepting a college coaching job, while his pregnant wife Tami (Connie Britton) and their 16-year-old daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) stayed behind in Dillon. Unfulfilled by his diminished duties and cognizant of the fact that he no longer is the head guy who calls all the shots, Eric returns to the Dillon Panthers. Meanwhile, Julie breaks up with starting quarterback Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford), who ends up finding love with a young nurse's aide. Paralyzed football hero Jason Street (Scott Porter) tries to find his place in the world, moving out of his parents' home and accepting--and then quitting--an assistant coaching job with the Dillon Panthers. And bad boy Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) gets thrown off the squad and ends up squatting in a meth dealer's home before Coach Taylor temporarily takes him in. But the strongest storyline belongs to Gaius Charles, who is pitch perfect as cocky star runningback Brian \"Smash\" Williams. Ensured a spot on a university with an elite football program, Williams believes that he is unstoppable. When a run-in with some racist kids turns into a media frenzy, the school rescinds its invitation and Smash finds himself scrambling to get into any school, regardless of its football program. A powerful actor who is equally adept at portraying a strutting football hero as he is a humbled teen, Charles conveys passion as well as numbing reality. Season two also deals with the aftermath of Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki) and Landry Clarke (Jesse Plemons), who try to cover up a murder. While the storyline is flawed and implausible, the actors do a stellar job with the material. It is also sweet to watch the couple's relationship--initially based on desperation--forge into a strong friendship and romance. Things don't always end neatly, but that only adds to the drama of Friday Night Lights . Look for series writer Peter Berg to guest star as Tami's former high-school boyfriend and Eric's nemesis. If the finale seems a little disjointed, it is because of the 2008 writers strike, which forced the series to truncate its episodes from a planned 22 episodes to just 15. The four-disc set also includes audio commentary and almost 40 minutes of deleted footage. --Jae-Ha Kim",

Star Jennifer Beals, Erin Daniels, Pam Grier Special Features: Widescreen format, featurettes 644 minutes. Amazon.com The third season of Showtime's The L Word is all about transitions. The season opens with Alice Pieszecki (Leisha Hailey) coping with her between-seasons break-up with Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels), who is herself headed for an even heavier series of transitions. Kit Porter (Pam Grier) both falls in love with a younger man and discovers she is going through menopause. Shane (Katherine Moennig), who spent much of the first two seasons of the show hopping from bed to bed, finds herself more or less committed to Latina deejay Carmen (Sarah Shahi). And the second season's resident villain, Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley), becomes embroiled in a sexual harassment case that leaves her ultimately looking like the victim. As with previous seasons, The L Word gets all hot and bothered with various seductions filmed to sometimes jarring music on the soundtrack, but it's the day-to-day foibles and celebrations of Los Angeles's lesbian community that keep the show interesting. Newcomer Moira/Max (Daniela Sea) begins the process of gender reassignment, making for some curious situations with potential employers. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) begin to drift apart when Tina lands a big movie studio job and starts feeling attracted to men, leading to a custody battle over their baby daughter. Where The L Word starts getting preachy and obvious is in the opening flashback sequences. When these vignettes refer to current characters of the show, they make sense; when they depict situations meant to underline how queer identity has evolved over the years, they seem politically overloaded. The L Word works intelligently through its characters' concerns without having to resort to such direct appeals for tolerance. Its strength isn't in making lesbian culture appear more mainstream, but in making us care and identify with these women's struggles, regardless of our sexual orientation. --Ryan Boudinot \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This season kept you guessing.

Meanwhile, Maggie's well-meaning but naive mother Lila gets divorced and decides to move to Vancouver and join the household. Soon after, Lila is befriended by Judy, a transsexual about to undergo a sex-change operation. Complications ensue as the conservative Lila learns the truth about Maggie, Judy, and their diverse group of friends. Amazon.com Many lesbian movies are long on charm and short on production values; Better Than Chocolate has a solid dose of both and steamy sex scenes to boot. Our heroine Maggie (Karyn Dwyer), a clerk at a lesbian bookstore, meets footloose butch Kim (Christina Cox) and, after Kim's van is towed away, they move in together. Unfortunately for their romantic bliss, Maggie's mother, Lila (Wendy Crewson), and teenage brother move in that very evening thanks to Lila's impending divorce. But what really complicates matters is that Maggie can't bring herself to come out to her mother; even when she tries, Lila steamrolls through the conversation, like she knows what's coming and doesn't want to hear it. Interwoven with this is the struggle of Judy (Peter Outerbridge), a male-to-female transsexual who's in love with the bookstore's owner, Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald), who's freaking out because customs officers are holding a list of books at the border that they claim are obscene. The overlapping plots are deftly juggled, the personal and political are compellingly interwoven, and, most satisfying of all, the characters have problems that aren't going to be easily resolved. A handful of candy-colored lip-synching musical numbers give the movie some flash and the sex scenes give the movie some heat, but it's the elements of sorrow and ambiguity that really make the joy in Better Than Chocolate something to savor. --Bret Fetzer \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is a great movie.

Star Jennifer Beals, Erin Daniels, Pam Grier Special Features: Widescreen format, featurettes 644 minutes. Amazon.com The third season of Showtime's The L Word is all about transitions. The season opens with Alice Pieszecki (Leisha Hailey) coping with her between-seasons break-up with Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels), who is herself headed for an even heavier series of transitions. Kit Porter (Pam Grier) both falls in love with a younger man and discovers she is going through menopause. Shane (Katherine Moennig), who spent much of the first two seasons of the show hopping from bed to bed, finds herself more or less committed to Latina deejay Carmen (Sarah Shahi). And the second season's resident villain, Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley), becomes embroiled in a sexual harassment case that leaves her ultimately looking like the victim. As with previous seasons, The L Word gets all hot and bothered with various seductions filmed to sometimes jarring music on the soundtrack, but it's the day-to-day foibles and celebrations of Los Angeles's lesbian community that keep the show interesting. Newcomer Moira/Max (Daniela Sea) begins the process of gender reassignment, making for some curious situations with potential employers. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) begin to drift apart when Tina lands a big movie studio job and starts feeling attracted to men, leading to a custody battle over their baby daughter. Where The L Word starts getting preachy and obvious is in the opening flashback sequences. When these vignettes refer to current characters of the show, they make sense; when they depict situations meant to underline how queer identity has evolved over the years, they seem politically overloaded. The L Word works intelligently through its characters' concerns without having to resort to such direct appeals for tolerance. Its strength isn't in making lesbian culture appear more mainstream, but in making us care and identify with these women's struggles, regardless of our sexual orientation. --Ryan Boudinot \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This season kept you guessing.

LP Man is an award winning adaptation based on the life of LP Man (Donnie Yen), the grandmaster of Wing Chun and later teacher and mentor to widely influential and legendary martial artist, Bruce Lee. LP Man is set in the 1930s in Foshan, a hub of southern Chinese martial arts just as the Second Sino-Japan war breaks out. During the war, China is nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife and warfare. LP Man rose like a Phoenix above these ashes as he defied an empire bringing hope to China. Winner of Best Picture and Actor, LP Man ranks as one of the best martial arts movies of all time! Review \"Ip Man is one of the best martial arts films of all time, hands down\"! --Twitch Films\"Donnie Yen, who's taking on real star charisma, is aces as Ip Man\"! --Variety",

With her encouragement, he becomes emboldened in his career as a window decorator as well as falling in love with the princess. James Spader's oily, stammering executive is just one of the many examples of a film that tries way too hard to be funny, the sort of characterization that would be barely adequate for a TV commercial, let alone a 90-minute movie. Still, for fans of Sex and the City who might want to feast upon the spectacle of a younger Kim Cattrall, Mannequin might offer a measure of relief. --David Stubbs Mannequin 2: On the Move Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you... The lyrics to \"Young at Heart\" could be the theme song for this, well, enchanting 1991 light teen comedy, a sequel to Mannequin . Kim Cattrall was the store window statue-come-to-life of the first film, and Kristy Swanson, pre- Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and is a natural for this sweet fable of a handsome prince breaking a centuries-old spell that trapped our sweet heroine in plastic. Fans of the more recent Enchanted will find much to like in the story of Jessie (Swanson) who, was cursed back in the old country to be a statue. Then department store employee Jason (William Ragsdale) removes the necklace from the mannequin that had cemented the curse, bringing Jessie back to life in a whole new world, which includes Meshach Taylor, reprising his role from the first film as reliable comic relief.

Poitier is very good as a man struggling with the extent of his commitment to the job, and even more as a teacher whose commitment is to proffering life lessons instead of academics.

Arguably, the best of the lot is The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), with Grant Williams as a businessman whose exposure to a radioactive cloud causes him to decrease in size exponentially until he is literally microscopic. Based on a novel by legendary fantasy writer Richard Matheson, director Jack ( Creature from the Black Lagoon ) Arnold's balance of suspense (Williams' battles with a house cat and common spider) and pathos (the effect his condition has on his marriage) make it one of the most memorable science-fiction films of the decade, and a favorite even of those with only a passing interest in the genre. On the entirely other end of the spectrum is The Mole People (1956), a loopy pulp adventure with John Agar and Hugh ( Leave It to Beaver ) Beaumont as intrepid adventurers who discover a lost city and the title creatures at a top of a Middle Eastern mountain. Campy to a fault, with a logic-straining script and ridiculous monsters, The Mole People is also a goofy good time for B-movie mavens. Agar, whose faded star power forced him to seek work in low-budget films during the '50s and '60s, also turns up in the effective Tarantula (1955), a fast-paced \"big bug\" creepshow modeled after Them!. (1954), and featuring a cameo by Clint Eastwood as a jet pilot; the rest of the set is rounded out by the truly wacky Monster on the Campus (1958), with Arthur Franz as a college professor whose exposure to a prehistoric fish turns him into a rampaging Neanderthal, and The Monolith Monsters (1957), about fragments of a meteor that grow to colossal heights when exposed to water and threaten a small desert community. For TV babies that grew up on a steady diet of Saturday afternoon monster movies, The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection offers a nostalgic trip back to those cathode-soaked days, but without the barrage of commercials. The set offers trailers for each film by way of extras, as well as an anamorphic presentation of The Incredible Shrinking Man ; the rest of the titles are presented in full screen. -- Paul Gaita \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Movies are scary, but good-------\nItem title: Speed Racer - Episodes 12-23 \n Item description: Product description SPEED RACER:VOL 2 (COLLECTOR'S EDITIO - DVD Movie Amazon.com In this second set of adventures, Speed and his friends race against a madman's robot-controlled car in \"Race for Revenge.\" Trixie gets jealous when Speed pays too much attention to the pretty title character in \"The Girl Daredevil.\" In \"The Desperate Desert Race,\" the gang is taken prisoner by rebel army leader Ali ben Schemer, a character who may offend Arab-American viewers. When Mach Go Go Go debuted in syndication in the U.S. as Speed Racer in 1967, the series had been extensively re-edited to excise much of the violence. These edits cause some continuity problems: in \"Girl Daredevil,\" new tires appear on the Mach-5 between two scenes, and a villain steals the car, although it was out of gas minutes earlier. As the exploits of Speed, Trixie, Sparks, Spritle, and Chim Chim remain a touchstone for fans who grew up watching them, members of Gen-Y are unlikely to be troubled by these awkward moments.

Agar, whose faded star power forced him to seek work in low-budget films during the '50s and '60s, also turns up in the effective Tarantula (1955), a fast-paced \"big bug\" creepshow modeled after Them!. (1954), and featuring a cameo by Clint Eastwood as a jet pilot; the rest of the set is rounded out by the truly wacky Monster on the Campus (1958), with Arthur Franz as a college professor whose exposure to a prehistoric fish turns him into a rampaging Neanderthal, and The Monolith Monsters (1957), about fragments of a meteor that grow to colossal heights when exposed to water and threaten a small desert community. For TV babies that grew up on a steady diet of Saturday afternoon monster movies, The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection offers a nostalgic trip back to those cathode-soaked days, but without the barrage of commercials. The set offers trailers for each film by way of extras, as well as an anamorphic presentation of The Incredible Shrinking Man ; the rest of the titles are presented in full screen. -- Paul Gaita  rating: 5.0  review: Movies are scary, but good-------Item title: Speed Racer - Episodes 12-23  Item description: Product description SPEED RACER:VOL 2 (COLLECTOR'S EDITIO - DVD Movie Amazon.com In this second set of adventures, Speed and his friends race against a madman's robot-controlled car in \"Race for Revenge.\" Trixie gets jealous when Speed pays too much attention to the pretty title character in \"The Girl Daredevil.\" In \"The Desperate Desert Race,\" the gang is taken prisoner by rebel army leader Ali ben Schemer, a character who may offend Arab-American viewers. When Mach Go Go Go debuted in syndication in the U.S. as Speed Racer in 1967, the series had been extensively re-edited to excise much of the violence. These edits cause some continuity problems: in \"Girl Daredevil,\" new tires appear on the Mach-5 between two scenes, and a villain steals the car, although it was out of gas minutes earlier. As the exploits of Speed, Trixie, Sparks, Spritle, and Chim Chim remain a touchstone for fans who grew up watching them, members of Gen-Y are unlikely to be troubled by these awkward moments.

        "ground_truth": "Title: In the Heat of the Night VHS \n Description: Amazon.com Both riveting murder mystery and classic fish-out-of-water yarn, Norman Jewison's Oscar-winning In the Heat of the Night represents Hollywood at its wiliest, cloaking expos\u00e9 in the most entertaining trappings. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger prove the decade's most formidable antagonists. Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, an arrogant homicide detective waylaid in Sparta, Mississippi; Steiger, in his bravura Oscar-winning turn, is Bill Gillespie, the town's hardheaded, bigoted sheriff who first arrests Tibbs for murder and then begs for his expertise. As the clues and suspects mount, Gillespie and his deputies develop begrudging respect for the black officer. The first-rate supporting cast includes Lee Grant as the victim's angry widow, Warren Oates as a voyeuristic deputy, William Schallert as the pragmatic mayor, and, in his screen debut, Scott Wilson ( In Cold Blood ) as an unlucky fugitive. The brilliant widescreen cinematography is by Haskell Wexler, and the scat-music score is by Quincy Jones. Ray Charles wails the blues theme song. --Glenn Lovell",

        "ground_truth": "Title: 24: Season 8 \n Description: Product Description Hang on for the adrenaline rush of a lifetime as Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) unveils darker secrets, faces deadlier conspiracies, and is thrust into more extreme action than ever before in Season 8 of 24 ! As Day Eight unfolds, Bauer races against the clock to prevent the assassination of a Middle Eastern leader on a vital peace-making mission. Meanwhile, a deadly terrorist threat against New York City intensifies and builds towards an explosive climax. \u00a0Relive the electrifying final season of TV's most groundbreaking series ever, including a surprise ending you simply must see. Amazon.com Network television's most exciting series ends with a bang--a lot of bangs, in fact, along with multiple bams, whams, and booms---as 24 bows out with this six-disc set of episodes from its eighth and final season. As the action begins in New York City, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), now a grandfather, has retired from his gig at the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) and plans to move to California to be with his family. Yeah, right. When he learns of a plot to assassinate President Omar Hassan (Anil Kapoor) of the mythical Islamic Republic of Kamistan--who's set to join the U.S. president, Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), and the Russian leader at the United Nations, where they will sign a historic agreement that will end Kamistan's nuclear program and bring lasting peace to the Middle East--Jack leaps right back into the fray. Needless to say, the plot thickens faster than the pools of congealed blood he inevitably leaves in his deadly wake. Who's behind the assassination scheme? Is it Hassan's power-hungry brother, who has no desire to give up his country's nukes, or is he in cahoots with bigger, more sinister forces? Are there even CTU operatives involved in these dastardly machinations? Can Jack trust a single soul other than himself? That he will get to the bottom of all of this (or the top, as a central conspiracy reaches to the very highest government levels) is a given. That he will indulge in some questionable tactics to do so, including cynically using his allies and brutally torturing his enemies (depicted in some intense and rather graphic scenes), is also expected, especially as his relationship with a disgraced former FBI agent (Annie Wersching) ups the personal ante for him to the point of near-madness. Whether he will survive this particular day intact, however, is another matter entirely. The makers of 24 have already shown that they're willing to go way over the top to preserve the central conceit (an entire season takes place in a single day, with each episode consuming one hour of that day), and the eighth season is no different. Plot twists that defy all credibility are not uncommon; there's no time to track down rumors or verify information, so the action tends to proceed in almost cartoon-like fashion. Many characters make cardboard look sturdy, especially the bad guys (a bunch of arrogant fools, craven traitors, and murderous louses). But that's what has made the show so addictive; it simply hurtles along, leaving no time to ask questions. And while the adventures of Jack Bauer, the ultimate one-man army, appear to be over for good, this season makes us wish that a day were just a bit longer then 24 hours. Bonus features include some extended episodes, \"scenemakers\" (detailed looks at certain scenes) for the majority of episodes, deleted scenes, and more. --Sam Graham",

Jam-packed with visually stunning musical numbers and an all-star cast featuring Eric Dane, Kristen Bell and Stanley Tucci. Amazon.com There is, according to Burlesque , a nightclub on the Sunset Strip that looks like a blend of Cabaret and Moulin Rouge and employs a full contingent of dancers and musicians in the service of a neo-retro-burlesque-blues program. Presiding over the craziness within is Tess, a grande dame who also performs occasionally and who could only, under these circumstances, be played by Cher. Entering the scene is a young leather-lunged hopeful from Iowa named Ali, played by Christina Aguilera in her movie-acting debut. The vibe of this glitzy concoction is more Flashdance than Showgirls , despite prerelease predictions that the film would be a campfest of epic proportions. In fact, it's more cornball than trashy. Ali hits most of the clich\u00e9s of the genre: defying Tess's skepticism by proving her mettle during an impromptu stage number; flirting with the nice-guy bartender (Cam Gigandet, of Twilight ) whose home she shares for a while, in a purely platonic way, of course, just until she gets her feet on the ground; and keeping a wary eye on the high roller (Eric Dane, of Grey's Anatomy ) who wants to possess her, because, you see, he takes whatever he likes. And did we mention that Tess is facing foreclosure on the club in a month's time? Seriously, you didn't see that coming? Writer-director Steve Antin has no embarrassment about putting any of this across, which may be why it all feels weirdly innocent, if relentlessly silly. Stanley Tucci revives his gay assistant from The Devil Wears Prada , Alan Cumming lurks about in an undefined role that might well have been filmed months after everybody else, and Kristen Bell enjoys a few wicked-witch moments as Ali's main rival. Aguilera, needless to say, belts out her songs as only someone with a very large voice can, and Cher stops the show with an old-fashioned torch song (\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\") that is clearly designed as a roof-raiser.

But he gets the shock of his life when the residents of Planet 51 mistakenly believe that his presence is the start of an alien invasion of the human kind! Luckily, Lem (Justin Long) quickly realizes that Chuck is friendly and makes it his personal mission to help him return safely to his ship. Amazon.com What if there are creatures living on other planets in other galaxies? And what if those creatures are a lot like us? When American astronaut Chuck Baker (Dwayne Johnson) lands on what's supposed to be barren, rocky planet devoid of life, he gets a big surprise. It seems that Planet 51 is home to little green people who are living in what's basically 1950s Americana--or should that be 1950s Alieana? Chuck bears a marked resemblance to Planet 51's science-fiction comic book and horror movie characters the \"Humaniacs,\" and hysteria breaks out because the little green men think his appearance marks the beginning of an alien invasion. Lem (Justin Long) is a junior curator at the local planetarium and one of the only people on the planet who is awed, rather than frightened, by the concept of a larger universe. While his fellow citizens set out to capture the invading alien, Lem believes Chuck when he declares that his mission is peaceful, and Lem risks his own safety to help him return to his ship and his home planet. With a little help from Rover (an American robot probe that has been sending rock samples back to Earth while ignoring the planet's life forms), Lem's neighbor and secret crush Neera (Jessica Biel), his friend Skiff (Seann William Scott), and hippie protester Glar (Alan Marriott), Lem just might be able to save Chuck. The question is--what will the personal consequences be for Lem? The story is an amusing twist on America's long-standing fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and the film has plenty of comic moments, but it ultimately lacks suspense and fails to truly engage the viewer.

Its greedy owner, Carrigan Crittendon (Cathy Moriarty), has hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the house's apparitions: a friendly but lonely young ghost named Casper, who's just looking for a friend, and his outrageous uncles Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso (The Ghostly Trio). If the plan works, she and Dibs (Eric Idle), her partner-in-slime, can get their hands on the manor's fabled treasure. Meanwhile, Casper has found a kindred spirit in Kat, but The Ghostly Trio will not tolerate \"fleshies\" in their house. With hilarious antics and dazzling special effects from many of the creators of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Jurassic Park, Casper is a mile-a-minute adventure comedy for the whole family.Bonus Content: Casper's Treasures Game Casper's Treasures Game Spelling Lab Game Spelling Lab Game Casper's Cartoon Classic: Penguin For Your Thoughts Casper's Cartoon Classic: Penguin For Your Thoughts Casper's Spooky Safety Tips Casper's Spooky Safety Tips Casper's Scary Kitchen Casper's Scary Kitchen Feature Commentary with Director Brad Silberling Feature Commentary with Director Brad Silberling Revealing Casper Revealing Casper Deleted Scene #91: Lucky Enough to be a Ghost Deleted Scene #91: Lucky Enough to be a Ghost Photo & Poster Gallery Photo & Poster Gallery",

Given that this two-sided, extra-laden disc is proffered as an \"official documentary,\" no one should be surprised that it embraces the former opinion. As director Damon Brown's film shows us, Burning Man (so named for the giant wooden sculpture that's set on fire on the final night) is not a concert, although there's plenty of music; it's not an exhibit, although there are many, many artists and a dizzying array of their works on hand; and it's not a festival, although a good time appears to be had by almost all. Above all, Burning Man is a phenomenon, as for one week every summer the Black Rock Desert becomes the fifth largest city in the state, home to well over 30,000 folks who create what some call \"another reality.\" None of this happens without a good deal of work. As the film chronicles the preparations for the 2003 event, we see that an enormous amount of technical and logistical details are involved, including laying out the roads and boundaries of the \"city,\" bringing in electrical power, dealing with local regulations (among which is the mandate that with the possible exception of a few footprints, every piece of evidence that Burning Man was ever there must be erased when it's over), and other infrastructural particulars. We meet some of the three thousand employees who labor year-round to keep it going (including founder-director Larry Harvey, who staged the first Burning Man for about 250 people in 1990), as well as a few of the participating artists (\"temple builder\" David Best designs an enormous structure every single year), and, of course, many of the participants. We visit \"theme camps\" and art installations, witness various amusements and ingenious contraptions, and listen to folks trying to explain not only what Burning Man is but what it means . Hours of bonus material (outtakes, extended interviews, deleted scenes, etc.) will help you draw your own conclusions. --Sam Graham \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This is a very well done vidoe. It covers the events that happen at Burning Man in the desert. I bought it to see what it is all about.

When their cave is destroyed, everything the Croods have ever known is rocked by seismic shifts and generational clashes as they discover an incredible new world filled with fantastic creatures - and their world is changed forever. If they don\u2019t evolve, they\u2019ll be history! Amazon.com Grug: The hardest working father in history. For Grug, there are no weekends, holidays or sick days. Like most dads, Grug is fiercely protective of his family, and his hyper-vigilance is defined by his \u201cfear is good; change is bad\u201d philosophy. But in order to keep his family truly safe, Grug must learn the difference between surviving and living.Ugga: Grug\u2019s mate. She\u2019s every bit as solid and sure as Grug, but over their many years of raising their children together, Ugga has always deferred to her husband\u2019s authority. When she suddenly finds herself in the position of being a cave-wife with no cave, Ugga is forced to make the right decision for her family -- even if it means changing the way they live.Eep: Grug\u2019s rebellious teenage daughter is trying to drag her family kicking and screaming into the future. Her nagging feeling that there might be more to life outside the family cave is confirmed when the Croods embark on a journey of a lifetime.Thunk: Grug\u2019s son is 6-feet, 3-inches tall, 280 pounds, and 9 years old. Thunk wants to be a great hunter like his dad, but Thunk can\u2019t hit the broad side of a mammoth.Gran: Grug\u2019s feisty mother-in-law is truly ancient, at age 45. Her twilight years haven\u2019t diminished her irascibility, or her instincts for survival.Sandy: The youngest of the Croods, four-year-old Sandy is as feral and vicious as a baby wildcat. In a dangerous world full of creatures trying to take a bite out of her, Sandy is not afraid to bite back.Guy: A charming teenage boy who makes dazzling discoveries (like fire and shoes), Guy is a catalyst for change. His inventive ideas ultimately expose the Croods to new possibilities... and a new world.Belt: This sloth is the world\u2019s first pet, and Guy\u2019s best friend. Belt can't talk, but his signature sing-song expression of doom \u2013 \u201cDa da daaaaaaaa!\u201d -- speaks volumes.Macawnivore: With the body of a small tiger, an over-sized head and the colorization of a Macaw Parrot, the Macawnivore is an imposing creature who towers over the Croods.Crocopup: An unexpected blend of canine and crocodile, his menacing looks and razor sharp teeth mask a friendly demeanor. Thunk makes him his pet, and names him Douglas.Punch Monkey: Fun and charming, until they feel threatened, the Punch Monkeys aren\u2019t easily intimidated and, as their name suggests, pack quite a wallop.Even breakfast is an adventure when you're the last surviving prehistoric family, and the conviction that fear keeps you alive and curiosity will get you killed definitely drives the Crood clan. But Eep (Emma Stone), who's in many ways a typical teenager intent on testing her boundaries and the resolve of her parents (Nicolas Cage and Catherine Keener), yearns for more than hiding out in a dark cave all day. Eep sneaks out of the cave one night and almost gets the whole family killed, but her path crosses with a boy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who it seems is destined to change everything for the Crood family. Forced to flee their cave home after it's destroyed, the Croods reluctantly follow Guy on a perilous journey that leads them to discover a whole new world full of breathtaking views, fascinating creatures, and blood-stirring adventure. The animation is lush and gorgeous and the abundance of physical and slapstick humor, especially from Nicolas Cage as Grug and Cloris Leachman as Gran, keeps the plot moving and viewers chuckling throughout the film. What the Crood family's journey eventually reveals is twofold: that focusing on living life and following the light is a viable alternative to hiding in the darkness and that anyone can change.

TV Guide Before the Internet, before reality TV, no one saw what television could be more humorously and with more vision than Garry Shandling. In 1986 Garry Shandling was poised to become a permanent guest host on Johnny Carsons The Tonight Show. Instead, he took a chance on an offer from fledgling cable network Showtime to create his own television series. No questions asked. A surreal look at the daily life of a young single man who is a comedian, Its Garry Shandlings Show was not a typical sitcom: Shandling would break the fourth wall to include the studio audience and the viewers at home in on the actual making of the show.

Given that this two-sided, extra-laden disc is proffered as an \"official documentary,\" no one should be surprised that it embraces the former opinion. As director Damon Brown's film shows us, Burning Man (so named for the giant wooden sculpture that's set on fire on the final night) is not a concert, although there's plenty of music; it's not an exhibit, although there are many, many artists and a dizzying array of their works on hand; and it's not a festival, although a good time appears to be had by almost all. Above all, Burning Man is a phenomenon, as for one week every summer the Black Rock Desert becomes the fifth largest city in the state, home to well over 30,000 folks who create what some call \"another reality.\" None of this happens without a good deal of work. As the film chronicles the preparations for the 2003 event, we see that an enormous amount of technical and logistical details are involved, including laying out the roads and boundaries of the \"city,\" bringing in electrical power, dealing with local regulations (among which is the mandate that with the possible exception of a few footprints, every piece of evidence that Burning Man was ever there must be erased when it's over), and other infrastructural particulars. We meet some of the three thousand employees who labor year-round to keep it going (including founder-director Larry Harvey, who staged the first Burning Man for about 250 people in 1990), as well as a few of the participating artists (\"temple builder\" David Best designs an enormous structure every single year), and, of course, many of the participants. We visit \"theme camps\" and art installations, witness various amusements and ingenious contraptions, and listen to folks trying to explain not only what Burning Man is but what it means . Hours of bonus material (outtakes, extended interviews, deleted scenes, etc.) will help you draw your own conclusions. --Sam Graham \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This is a very well done vidoe.

When their cave is destroyed, everything the Croods have ever known is rocked by seismic shifts and generational clashes as they discover an incredible new world filled with fantastic creatures - and their world is changed forever. If they don\u2019t evolve, they\u2019ll be history! Amazon.com Grug: The hardest working father in history. For Grug, there are no weekends, holidays or sick days. Like most dads, Grug is fiercely protective of his family, and his hyper-vigilance is defined by his \u201cfear is good; change is bad\u201d philosophy. But in order to keep his family truly safe, Grug must learn the difference between surviving and living.Ugga: Grug\u2019s mate. She\u2019s every bit as solid and sure as Grug, but over their many years of raising their children together, Ugga has always deferred to her husband\u2019s authority. When she suddenly finds herself in the position of being a cave-wife with no cave, Ugga is forced to make the right decision for her family -- even if it means changing the way they live.Eep: Grug\u2019s rebellious teenage daughter is trying to drag her family kicking and screaming into the future. Her nagging feeling that there might be more to life outside the family cave is confirmed when the Croods embark on a journey of a lifetime.Thunk: Grug\u2019s son is 6-feet, 3-inches tall, 280 pounds, and 9 years old. Thunk wants to be a great hunter like his dad, but Thunk can\u2019t hit the broad side of a mammoth.Gran: Grug\u2019s feisty mother-in-law is truly ancient, at age 45. Her twilight years haven\u2019t diminished her irascibility, or her instincts for survival.Sandy: The youngest of the Croods, four-year-old Sandy is as feral and vicious as a baby wildcat. In a dangerous world full of creatures trying to take a bite out of her, Sandy is not afraid to bite back.Guy: A charming teenage boy who makes dazzling discoveries (like fire and shoes), Guy is a catalyst for change. His inventive ideas ultimately expose the Croods to new possibilities... and a new world.Belt: This sloth is the world\u2019s first pet, and Guy\u2019s best friend. Belt can't talk, but his signature sing-song expression of doom \u2013 \u201cDa da daaaaaaaa!\u201d -- speaks volumes.Macawnivore: With the body of a small tiger, an over-sized head and the colorization of a Macaw Parrot, the Macawnivore is an imposing creature who towers over the Croods.Crocopup: An unexpected blend of canine and crocodile, his menacing looks and razor sharp teeth mask a friendly demeanor. Thunk makes him his pet, and names him Douglas.Punch Monkey: Fun and charming, until they feel threatened, the Punch Monkeys aren\u2019t easily intimidated and, as their name suggests, pack quite a wallop.Even breakfast is an adventure when you're the last surviving prehistoric family, and the conviction that fear keeps you alive and curiosity will get you killed definitely drives the Crood clan. But Eep (Emma Stone), who's in many ways a typical teenager intent on testing her boundaries and the resolve of her parents (Nicolas Cage and Catherine Keener), yearns for more than hiding out in a dark cave all day. Eep sneaks out of the cave one night and almost gets the whole family killed, but her path crosses with a boy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who it seems is destined to change everything for the Crood family. Forced to flee their cave home after it's destroyed, the Croods reluctantly follow Guy on a perilous journey that leads them to discover a whole new world full of breathtaking views, fascinating creatures, and blood-stirring adventure. The animation is lush and gorgeous and the abundance of physical and slapstick humor, especially from Nicolas Cage as Grug and Cloris Leachman as Gran, keeps the plot moving and viewers chuckling throughout the film. What the Crood family's journey eventually reveals is twofold: that focusing on living life and following the light is a viable alternative to hiding in the darkness and that anyone can change.

TV Guide Before the Internet, before reality TV, no one saw what television could be more humorously and with more vision than Garry Shandling. In 1986 Garry Shandling was poised to become a permanent guest host on Johnny Carsons The Tonight Show. Instead, he took a chance on an offer from fledgling cable network Showtime to create his own television series. No questions asked. A surreal look at the daily life of a young single man who is a comedian, Its Garry Shandlings Show was not a typical sitcom: Shandling would break the fourth wall to include the studio audience and the viewers at home in on the actual making of the show.

The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurrence in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944. Amazon.com When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe with Duel in his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan , his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds. A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winning Schindler's List , but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut.

Das Boot puts you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen. --Jim Emerson \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Excellent!-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "input": "Below is the previous historical purchases and reviews of the user:```Item title: Saving Private Ryan  Item description: Product Description Steven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurrence in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944. Amazon.com When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe with Duel in his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan , his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds. A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winning Schindler's List , but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose. Saving Private Ryan touches us deeper than Schindler because it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make. --Doug Thomas  rating: 5.0  review: Excellent addition to hubby's movie collection.-------Item title: Broken Trail [Blu-ray]  Item description: Top-rated miniseries!

        "ground_truth": "Title: Signs \n Description: Product Description From M. Night Shyamalan, the writer/director of THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, comes the story of the Hess family in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who wake up one morning to find a 500-foot crop circle in their backyard. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family are told extraterrestrials are responsible for the sign in their field. They watch, with growing dread, the news of crop circles being found all over the world. SIGNS is the emotional story of one family on one farm as they encounter the terrifying last moments of life as the world is being invaded. \"It's easy for a filmmaker to blow up the world -- but what Shyamalan does is much riskier. He tries to blow our minds. I was engaged by every inch of SIGNS.\" - Richard Roeper, Ebert & Roeper. Additional Features The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies. Signs is the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack. --Doug Thomas",

Outstanding animation and music done right with anamorphic widescreen video and surround sound audio (5.1 English, 5.1 Japanese)! Amazon.com The mayhem and imagination never flag in director Shinchiro Watanabe's first series since Cowboy Bebop . Fuu poses for a Ukiyo-e (woodblock print) artist, only to discover he's tied to a criminal ring that traffics in young girls. She joins Mugen and Jin to escort gay Dutch trader Izaak Titsingh on a tour of Edo. Izaak tries to pass himself off as Japanese--despite an Ahnold-esque accent. The clever, well-researched visuals in these episodes play off Van Gogh's paintings, shunga (erotic) prints, Kabuki costumes, and the 17th-century anthology The Great Mirror of Male Love . \"The Art of Altercation\" reveals just enough of Jinn's past to explain why the taciturn swordsman has so many enemies. All four episodes offer plenty of the outrageous mixture of traditional martial arts and cutting-edge hip-hop moves that have made Samurai Champloo a fan favorite. (Rated 16 and older: violence, profanity, brief nudity, sexual situations, alcohol and tobacco use) --Charles Solomon \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Watching Samurai Champloo is, at times,  an uneven experience.<br /><br />Watanabe brings his audience exactly what they expect: quality. The music is a stellar mix of traditional Japanese folk songs and hip-hop beats. The art is beautiful and the story line is engaging. The characters are interesting and fully developed by the conclusion of the series.<br /><br />In certain ways Watanabe has improved on Cowboy Bebop. Samurai Champloo leaves no gaps in the lives of the characters or the motives behind their actions. Watanabe fleshes out the story line completely and evenly. The journey of Fuu, Jin, and Mugen moves steadily and the conclusion lasts three episodes; the most important segments of the show take place over more than one episode and have a much more prolonged affect. And unlike Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo effectively introduces elements of past history into its story line: the Satsuma Rebellion and the Tale of Heiki/Genji for example.<br /><br />However, Samurai Champloo suffers from overflow. No anime in recent memort has provided its audience with side characters of such depth. The villians and friends they meet on their journey feel as real and as significant as Fuu, Jin, and Mugen. But there is simply too many of them and they occupy too many episodes.<br /><br />Episodes such as \"Baseball Blues\", \"Cosmic Collisions\", \"Art of Altercation\", \"Beat Box Bandits\", and \"War of Words\" have too many eccentric characters and are not relevant to the story. They are single episode stories that drag down the flow of progress. A single season show shouldn't feel like it has filler episodes to reach 23 weeks of airplay.

Mugen, Jin and Fuu need money fast. Fuu tries to model, but it turns out to be a trap. When they arrive in the capital city, they delay their quest to join an eating contest, but find out the hard way they need to watch who they hang with! If some guy they meet isn\u0092t wanted by the cops, then he\u0092s trying to kill them or take their wallet- either way, you know they\u0092re going to wind up in the middle of a fight... The outstanding animation directed by SHINICHIRO WATANABE (Cowboy Bebop, Animatrix), designed by KAZUTO NAKAZAWA (Kill Bill Vol.1) and MAHIRO MAEDA (Last Exile, Blue Submarine No.6) and powered by fresh sounds from Tsutchie, fat jon, Nujabes and FORCE OF NATURE! Outstanding animation and music done right with anamorphic widescreen video and surround sound audio (5.1 English, 5.1 Japanese)! Amazon.com The mayhem and imagination never flag in director Shinchiro Watanabe's first series since Cowboy Bebop . Fuu poses for a Ukiyo-e (woodblock print) artist, only to discover he's tied to a criminal ring that traffics in young girls. She joins Mugen and Jin to escort gay Dutch trader Izaak Titsingh on a tour of Edo. Izaak tries to pass himself off as Japanese--despite an Ahnold-esque accent. The clever, well-researched visuals in these episodes play off Van Gogh's paintings, shunga (erotic) prints, Kabuki costumes, and the 17th-century anthology The Great Mirror of Male Love . \"The Art of Altercation\" reveals just enough of Jinn's past to explain why the taciturn swordsman has so many enemies. All four episodes offer plenty of the outrageous mixture of traditional martial arts and cutting-edge hip-hop moves that have made Samurai Champloo a fan favorite. (Rated 16 and older: violence, profanity, brief nudity, sexual situations, alcohol and tobacco use) --Charles Solomon  rating: 4.0  review: Watching Samurai Champloo is, at times,  an uneven experience.<br /><br />Watanabe brings his audience exactly what they expect: quality. The music is a stellar mix of traditional Japanese folk songs and hip-hop beats. The art is beautiful and the story line is engaging. The characters are interesting and fully developed by the conclusion of the series.<br /><br />In certain ways Watanabe has improved on Cowboy Bebop. Samurai Champloo leaves no gaps in the lives of the characters or the motives behind their actions. Watanabe fleshes out the story line completely and evenly. The journey of Fuu, Jin, and Mugen moves steadily and the conclusion lasts three episodes; the most important segments of the show take place over more than one episode and have a much more prolonged affect. And unlike Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo effectively introduces elements of past history into its story line: the Satsuma Rebellion and the Tale of Heiki/Genji for example.<br /><br />However, Samurai Champloo suffers from overflow. No anime in recent memort has provided its audience with side characters of such depth. The villians and friends they meet on their journey feel as real and as significant as Fuu, Jin, and Mugen. But there is simply too many of them and they occupy too many episodes.<br /><br />Episodes such as \"Baseball Blues\", \"Cosmic Collisions\", \"Art of Altercation\", \"Beat Box Bandits\", and \"War of Words\" have too many eccentric characters and are not relevant to the story. They are single episode stories that drag down the flow of progress. A single season show shouldn't feel like it has filler episodes to reach 23 weeks of airplay. In certain cases - these side-stories provide great entertainment. My favorite episode happens to be a single episode story - \"Gamblers and Gallantry.\" But more often than not, the audience may feel like the series is dragging on with extra filler adventures that affect neither the three main characters or the audience to any great degree.<br /><br />Despite this weakness, I do highly recommend the show.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Samurai Champloo, Volume 1 (Episodes 1-4) [DVD] \n Description: Product Description Mugen's a buck wild warrior - violent, thoughtless and womanizing. Jin is a vagrant ronin - mysterious, traditional, well-mannered and very strong as well. These two fiercely independent warriors can't be any more different from one another, yet their paths cross when Fuu, a ditzy waitress, saves them from being executed when they are arrested after a violent swordfight. Fuu convinces the two vagrant young men to help her find a mysterious samurai \"who smells of sunflowers.\" And their journey begins. This is a story about love, friendship and courage . . . . NOT! Amazon.com Viewers eagerly awaited director Shinichiro Watanabe's first broadcast series since Cowboy Bebop , and this quirky, violent period adventure was worth the wait. In contrast to the jazz-inflected disillusionment of Bebop , Champloo offers an edgy mix of martial arts combat and hip-hop irreverence. A string of coincidences brings together three misfits in Meiji-era Japan: Mugen, a rebellious vagabond; Jin, a taciturn ronin; and Fuu, a nutty waitress. Mugen, whose sardonic posture recalls Spike Spiegel, is a formidable swordsman, but he lacks the polish of a great martial artist. His movements, which incorporate break dance spins and flips, reflect his undisciplined nature. Jin is cool to the point of iciness: When he unsheathes his sword, he becomes a deadly work of art in motion. After helping them escape execution, Fuu demands Jin and Mugen stop fighting until they've helped her find an unnamed samurai \"who smells of sun flowers.\" Predictably, chaos ensues.

An experience beyond everything you've ever imagined. Behind the red velvet curtain, the ultimate seduction of your senses is about to begin. Welcome to the Moulin Rouge!

Enter a tantalizing world that celebrates truth, beauty, freedom and above all things, love. Additional Features The \"Spectacular, Spectacular\" theme of Moulin Rouge continues with the two-DVD set's dazzling array of extras, a must-watch for the Moulin Rouge fanatic. The first disc contains the film along with two commentary tracks--one with Baz Luhrmann, the production designer, and the cinematographer, the second with Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, the writers of the film. Both commentaries contain lots of interesting and fun facts about the making of the film, including back story on the characters that was eventually cut, Courtney Love's long deliberation before allowing the use of Nirvana's \"Teen Spirit,\" and contributions to the story made by the film's stars. The second disc contains a making-of documentary, amusing footage of McGregor and Kidman goofing around on the set, and interviews with all the major stars. Deleted scenes, extended dance numbers, the MTV music-awards performance of \"Lady Marmalade,\" and many more extras make for a detailed look inside Moulin Rouge that's bursting with as much energy as the nightclub itself. --Mindy Ruehmann \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This movie had it all music and great songs.

Balancing suspense and satire as deftly as the scale of justice, Horace Rumpole tirelessly defends the downtrodden while undressing the upper classes. A timeless mixture of comedy and drama, RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY was one of television's most celebrated courtroom dramas. Flawlessly adapted by John Mortimer from his best-selling Edgar Award-winning novels, and starring the esteemed Leo McKern (A Man for All Seasons), this 14-disc DVD Megaset\u0099 includes all 42 episodes from the seven seasons of RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY. DVD Features: Feature-Length Bonus Movie Rumpole's Return; Mortimer's Musings--An Interview with John Mortimer; McKern's Memories with Actress Abigail McKern (Daughter of Leo McKern); Episode Introductions with John Mortimer; Spot the Barrister-Highlighting John Mortimer's Impromptu Appearances; Newspaper Evidence; John Mortimer Biography; John Mortimer Bibliography and Selected Credits; About the Old Bailey; Official Executioners of Newgate Prison; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection Amazon.com Before there was Quincy and The Practice , there was Rumpole . Rumpole of the Bailey is, quite simply, one of the finest television series, and it has served as a model for all law dramas that followed it. Edgy and satirical, Rumpole is based on John Mortimer's books of the same name. A determined and committed criminal defense barrister (whose clients have included three generations of the Timson family, among others) at the Old Bailey (criminal court), esteemed actor Leo McKern portrays the antihero Rumpole. As champion of the downtrodden, the self-righteous Rumpole loves to get in trouble with his wife Hilda, his peers, the head of chambers, and judges, to name but a few. A connoisseur of Wordsworth, cigars, and cheap liquor, McKern's usually disheveled Rumpole belies the character's dry sense of humor and astute skill as a barrister. The upwardly mobile Hilda is played by Peggy Thorpe-Bates, known for her Miss Toliver in Alcatraz Island , and Justice Sir Guthrie Fetherston is played by Peter Bowles, known for his Richard DeVere in TV's To the Manor Born . Typical of British drama, production values are low while the caliber of scriptwriting and acting is unsurpassed. Rumpole is a rare example of a television serial that is as appealing and engaging on its 10th viewing as it was on its first. A&E's 14-disc megaset includes all 42 episodes from the series' seven seasons, plus the 1982 two-hour special Rumpole's Return , introductions by and an interview with John Mortimer, and other bonus material. --Erik Macki \n rating: 5.0 \n review: In box with plastic wrap and no peanuts that was a plus and everything was great and packgaged well yay.-------\nItem title: Prom Night (Unrated) \n Item description: Product Description Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow, John Tucker Must Die) watched in horror as an obsessed predator (Johnathon Schaech, That Thing You Do!) murdered her family. Tonight is her senior prom and although she's anxious about the past, she's excited to celebrate her future with her friends. What Donna doesn't know is that the deranged psychopath has escaped from the asylum. He's returned to hunt her down, intent on killing anyone who gets in his way. As the night races towards its heart-pounding conclusion, the question becomes not who will be prom queen, but who will survive the killer's rampage. Amazon.com An attractive cast of young performers lead by Brittany Snow ( Hairspray ) is the main selling point for Prom Night , a remake of the 1980 Canadian slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis. Snow makes for a capable lead as the sole survivor of her family's massacre at the hands of an obsessed teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who returns three years later to finish his campaign on the eve of her senior prom. While no one's idea of a classic horror film, the Paul Lynch-directed Prom Night offered viewers a modest whodunit angle in between the killings; here, the villain's identity is known from the get-go, and what's left is a string of mechanical stalkings (which feature a surprisingly modest amount of blood) and reams of turgid teenspeak, which is handled as best as possible by Snow and her cast mates. The end result is a dull, suspense-free chiller that manages to make its mediocre source material seem inspired by comparison. Older moviegoers may note the presence of actors Idris Elba and James Ransone, both used so well on The Wire , and so thoroughly wasted here. -- Paul Gaita Stills from Prom Night (click for larger image) \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great packaging in a box and sealed with plastic  wrap everything was good like it should be all of the time.-------\nItem title: Cake Boss: Season 2 \n Item description: Season Two sends the flour flying as Buddy and company create outrageous masterpieces while popularity continues to rise.

An experience beyond everything you've ever imagined. Behind the red velvet curtain, the ultimate seduction of your senses is about to begin. Welcome to the Moulin Rouge! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing, dance and scale the heights of passionate abandon in the year's most talked-about movie from visionary director Baz Luhrmann (William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom). Enter a tantalizing world that celebrates truth, beauty, freedom and above all things, love. Additional Features The \"Spectacular, Spectacular\" theme of Moulin Rouge continues with the two-DVD set's dazzling array of extras, a must-watch for the Moulin Rouge fanatic. The first disc contains the film along with two commentary tracks--one with Baz Luhrmann, the production designer, and the cinematographer, the second with Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, the writers of the film. Both commentaries contain lots of interesting and fun facts about the making of the film, including back story on the characters that was eventually cut, Courtney Love's long deliberation before allowing the use of Nirvana's \"Teen Spirit,\" and contributions to the story made by the film's stars. The second disc contains a making-of documentary, amusing footage of McGregor and Kidman goofing around on the set, and interviews with all the major stars. Deleted scenes, extended dance numbers, the MTV music-awards performance of \"Lady Marmalade,\" and many more extras make for a detailed look inside Moulin Rouge that's bursting with as much energy as the nightclub itself. --Mindy Ruehmann \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This movie had it all music and great songs.  Awesome direction.  The love scenes were wonderful I watch it over and over again.  The colors and music just great.  The actors and actresses wonderful.  This movie is so truly moving.-------\nItem title: Rumpole of the Bailey: The Complete Series Megaset [DVD] \n Item description: Product Description An immensely popular series broadcast on PBS from 1978 to 1992, RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY set a new bar for all courtroom dramas to come. Balancing suspense and satire as deftly as the scale of justice, Horace Rumpole tirelessly defends the downtrodden while undressing the upper classes. A timeless mixture of comedy and drama, RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY was one of television's most celebrated courtroom dramas. Flawlessly adapted by John Mortimer from his best-selling Edgar Award-winning novels, and starring the esteemed Leo McKern (A Man for All Seasons), this 14-disc DVD Megaset\u0099 includes all 42 episodes from the seven seasons of RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY. DVD Features: Feature-Length Bonus Movie Rumpole's Return; Mortimer's Musings--An Interview with John Mortimer; McKern's Memories with Actress Abigail McKern (Daughter of Leo McKern); Episode Introductions with John Mortimer; Spot the Barrister-Highlighting John Mortimer's Impromptu Appearances; Newspaper Evidence; John Mortimer Biography; John Mortimer Bibliography and Selected Credits; About the Old Bailey; Official Executioners of Newgate Prison; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection Amazon.com Before there was Quincy and The Practice , there was Rumpole . Rumpole of the Bailey is, quite simply, one of the finest television series, and it has served as a model for all law dramas that followed it. Edgy and satirical, Rumpole is based on John Mortimer's books of the same name. A determined and committed criminal defense barrister (whose clients have included three generations of the Timson family, among others) at the Old Bailey (criminal court), esteemed actor Leo McKern portrays the antihero Rumpole. As champion of the downtrodden, the self-righteous Rumpole loves to get in trouble with his wife Hilda, his peers, the head of chambers, and judges, to name but a few. A connoisseur of Wordsworth, cigars, and cheap liquor, McKern's usually disheveled Rumpole belies the character's dry sense of humor and astute skill as a barrister. The upwardly mobile Hilda is played by Peggy Thorpe-Bates, known for her Miss Toliver in Alcatraz Island , and Justice Sir Guthrie Fetherston is played by Peter Bowles, known for his Richard DeVere in TV's To the Manor Born . Typical of British drama, production values are low while the caliber of scriptwriting and acting is unsurpassed. Rumpole is a rare example of a television serial that is as appealing and engaging on its 10th viewing as it was on its first. A&E's 14-disc megaset includes all 42 episodes from the series' seven seasons, plus the 1982 two-hour special Rumpole's Return , introductions by and an interview with John Mortimer, and other bonus material. --Erik Macki \n rating: 5.0 \n review: In box with plastic wrap and no peanuts that was a plus and everything was great and packgaged well yay.-------\nItem title: Prom Night (Unrated) \n Item description: Product Description Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow, John Tucker Must Die) watched in horror as an obsessed predator (Johnathon Schaech, That Thing You Do!) murdered her family. Tonight is her senior prom and although she's anxious about the past, she's excited to celebrate her future with her friends. What Donna doesn't know is that the deranged psychopath has escaped from the asylum. He's returned to hunt her down, intent on killing anyone who gets in his way. As the night races towards its heart-pounding conclusion, the question becomes not who will be prom queen, but who will survive the killer's rampage. Amazon.com An attractive cast of young performers lead by Brittany Snow ( Hairspray ) is the main selling point for Prom Night , a remake of the 1980 Canadian slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis. Snow makes for a capable lead as the sole survivor of her family's massacre at the hands of an obsessed teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who returns three years later to finish his campaign on the eve of her senior prom. While no one's idea of a classic horror film, the Paul Lynch-directed Prom Night offered viewers a modest whodunit angle in between the killings; here, the villain's identity is known from the get-go, and what's left is a string of mechanical stalkings (which feature a surprisingly modest amount of blood) and reams of turgid teenspeak, which is handled as best as possible by Snow and her cast mates. The end result is a dull, suspense-free chiller that manages to make its mediocre source material seem inspired by comparison. Older moviegoers may note the presence of actors Idris Elba and James Ransone, both used so well on The Wire , and so thoroughly wasted here. -- Paul Gaita Stills from Prom Night (click for larger image) \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great packaging in a box and sealed with plastic  wrap everything was good like it should be all of the time.-------\nItem title: Cake Boss: Season 2 \n Item description: Season Two sends the flour flying as Buddy and company create outrageous masterpieces while popularity continues to rise. Wildly themed cakes from cage-fighting and life-sized race cars to the Bronx Zoo s birthday and poisonous plants keep the kitchen hopping. Buddy also dishes up come surprises with talking cakes and wedding proposals, but when the crew has to craft fifty wedding cakes in seven days, they wonder if they can stand the heat. From Upper-East-Side socialites to Hells Angels, clients continue to flock to the Boss to test his creativity, and Buddy still blows them away with the unique designs that come only from the Cake Boss kitchen. Over 40 minutes of bonus content! \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Buddy and his team are the best you can learn a lot from watching these and they are fun to watch.-------\nItem title: Get Smart [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Get Smart (BD) 2008 In the world of covert intelligence, only one man is Smart. Steve Carell is in CONTROL as Maxwell Smart, the novice agent often out of his depths but never out of options in this action comedy pitting him against the nuclear scheme of the evil spy group KAOS. Anne Hathaway partners with Max as ever-capable Agent 99. And director Peter Segal (The Longest Yard ) guides his stars (including Dwayne Johnson and Alan Arkin) through the dangerous realm of molar radios, multifunction pocketknives, exploding dental floss and more. ]]> \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Packaged in a box with plastic wrap and no naughty peanuts had to follow it was wrapped really well good.-------\nItem title: Perry Mason (50th Anniversary Edition) \n Item description: Perry Mason is an attorney who specializes in defending seemingly indefensible cases.

After inheriting his father's machine tool company, the young Howard Hughes discovers he can combine his passions--flying, moviemaking and women--by coming to Hollywood. In 1930, while building one of the world's largest aviation companies, Hughes produces Hell's Angels, a perfectionist's homage to World War I flyers. The man who eventually produces almost 30 films shocks society with The Outlaw, starring buxom Jane Russell, builds the world's largest airplane, sets the world speed record and invents the half-cup bra. ]]> Amazon.com From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese's The Aviator celebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover, The Aviator is easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish. --Jeff Shannon DVD Features In his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films. He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\" But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film. That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately). The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in the Hell's Angels flying sequence. The second disc collects almost three hours of features. There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other. More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances. Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies). More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda. --David Horiuchi The Personalities of The Aviator Click the links to explore more movies by these stars. Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes \"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind. And if I did it... it would be like flying blind.\" Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn Howard Hughes: \"You're the tallest woman I have ever met.\"  Katharine Hepburn: \"And all sharp elbows and knees. Beware.\" Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner Howard Hughes: \"Does that look clean to you?\"  Ava Gardner: \"Nothing's clean, Howard.

This is the first film feature version that I have found the \"Features\" disk to be worthwhile. It held me spellbound. Every aspect of the special features (found listed elsewhere) were extremely interesting, accurate as to aviation aspects and even the discussion of medical aspects (maybe more so to other physicians). Every aspect such as the set designs, costumes and special effects to enhance the visual impressions held my interest. Documentaries from other media added greatly to the completeness of the Howard Hughes bibliography. For example, the aerospace developments which derived from innovations pioneered by the largely non-formally schooled engineer, inventor and innovator, Howard Hughes. The scene listings do not do complete justice to describing the content of what you will find there. I found it a completely captivating feature film in its own right. A *Must See* presentation.-------\nItem title: Big Wednesday \n Item description: No matter what rolls in on the tides of time, California surfing buddies Matt, Jack, and Leroy know they'll stick together. And, they know they'll be ready when a rare 20-foot swell hits the coast at last. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I bought this film mainly to see how they did the surfing scenes with actors. But Gary Busey has already managed to raise my regard for his skills in this venue as well. Unforgettable is his portrayal of Buddy Holly in that film. He actually did all that singing himself. Recently he has gotten typecast as a heavy, but in this film he is very ordinary but possessing surfing prowess that is remarkable. Then both Jan-Michael Vincent and William Katt turned in memorable performances as well. I give this film the highest rating for actor's performances as well as for an enjoyable screenplay. It does not suffer in either department.-------\nItem title: 411VM Surfing 01 \n Item description:  \n rating: 1.0 \n review: Its not even worth the cost of the shipping. Some surfing shots, poorly done, obviously not in a style acceptable to us Yanks. Contrast with a long story about skateboarding and designing skateboard shoes. Add a story about a roommate hogs wouldn't live like. Overall, not up to American standards and not worthy to exist alongside surfing.-------\nItem title: Blue Crush [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Set amid the stunning island paradise of Hawaii\u2019s fabled North Shore, surfer Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) takes on the ultimate challenge to make her pipe dream into a reality. With the support of her two friends (Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake), Anne Marie discovers she must overcome her fears before she can conquer the waves. Hailed as an exhilarating \u201cfun ride\u201d by People Magazine, Blue Crush is an adrenaline-powered story of heartfelt friendship and non-stop action that The Washington Post raves is \u201ca big, sexy, sun-splashed thrill.\u201dBonus Content: BD-Live BD-Live Pocket Blu Pocket Blu \n rating: 5.0 \n review: After seeing this on Netflix I sought out owning it and Blue Crush 1. I was very impressed with the stars in these films, and I particularly liked Kate Bosworth. Quite a surprise was Michelle Rodriguez. This young lady is one of the most versatile actresses I have ever seen. She plays a good warrior, (I've yet to see her in a part as a young ing\u00e9nue), and she certainly shows skill in driving and also with the jet ski. I'm convinced she did some of the surfing shown in the film herself, though Hollywood has its ways. I gave this film 5 stars and as a Blu-Ray it is quite breathtaking to see the North Shore surf. Its in good company with BC2 and the other good surfing films beginning with John Millius's (an accomplished surfer himself) \"Big Wednesday.\"-------\nItem title: Carmen \n Item description: All the passion and spectacle of Bizet's Carmen comes to life in this dazzling screen opera starring Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes-Johnson. In 19th century Seville, the lusty, tempestuous Carmen (Migenes-Johnson) seduces a naive Army corporal, Don Jose (Domingo), newly assigned to the village fortress. Jose abandons his career, his fianc\u201ae and even his dying mother for the love of this sultry gypsy. But soon she spurns him in favor of a toreador, Escamillo (Ruggero Raimondi). Crazed with jealousy, Jose begs Carmen to return to him, but her taunting declaration of independence results in tragedy. Shot entirely on location in Andalusia Spain, Bizet's Carmen has been hailed as the definitive version of this classic opera. Superbly directed by Francesco Rosi (Illustrious Corpses). NOTE: There will be silence for 20 seconds at the beginning of the movie after which you can hear audience cheering.This is made intentionally by the studio. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I had this opera for years on a VHS tape. I watched it in 1990 with a lady friend one night when she was on duty managing a group home.  She later was taken a degenerative illness but I treasured the experience of seeing her enjoyment with her first opera view. Now I was glad to have this version.

More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances. Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies). More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda. --David Horiuchi The Personalities of The Aviator Click the links to explore more movies by these stars. Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes \"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind. And if I did it... it would be like flying blind.\" Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn Howard Hughes: \"You're the tallest woman I have ever met.\"  Katharine Hepburn: \"And all sharp elbows and knees. Beware.\" Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner Howard Hughes: \"Does that look clean to you?\"  Ava Gardner: \"Nothing's clean, Howard.

Break out those sails and watch them fill with the wind that's carrying us all to freedom!\" Director Martin Scorsese \"You get a sense of Howard Hughes being Icarus with the wax wings.

This is the first film feature version that I have found the \"Features\" disk to be worthwhile. It held me spellbound. Every aspect of the special features (found listed elsewhere) were extremely interesting, accurate as to aviation aspects and even the discussion of medical aspects (maybe more so to other physicians). Every aspect such as the set designs, costumes and special effects to enhance the visual impressions held my interest. Documentaries from other media added greatly to the completeness of the Howard Hughes bibliography. For example, the aerospace developments which derived from innovations pioneered by the largely non-formally schooled engineer, inventor and innovator, Howard Hughes. The scene listings do not do complete justice to describing the content of what you will find there. I found it a completely captivating feature film in its own right. A *Must See* presentation.-------\nItem title: Big Wednesday \n Item description: No matter what rolls in on the tides of time, California surfing buddies Matt, Jack, and Leroy know they'll stick together. And, they know they'll be ready when a rare 20-foot swell hits the coast at last. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I bought this film mainly to see how they did the surfing scenes with actors. But Gary Busey has already managed to raise my regard for his skills in this venue as well. Unforgettable is his portrayal of Buddy Holly in that film. He actually did all that singing himself. Recently he has gotten typecast as a heavy, but in this film he is very ordinary but possessing surfing prowess that is remarkable. Then both Jan-Michael Vincent and William Katt turned in memorable performances as well. I give this film the highest rating for actor's performances as well as for an enjoyable screenplay. It does not suffer in either department.-------\nItem title: 411VM Surfing 01 \n Item description:  \n rating: 1.0 \n review: Its not even worth the cost of the shipping. Some surfing shots, poorly done, obviously not in a style acceptable to us Yanks. Contrast with a long story about skateboarding and designing skateboard shoes. Add a story about a roommate hogs wouldn't live like. Overall, not up to American standards and not worthy to exist alongside surfing.-------\nItem title: Blue Crush [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Set amid the stunning island paradise of Hawaii\u2019s fabled North Shore, surfer Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) takes on the ultimate challenge to make her pipe dream into a reality. With the support of her two friends (Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake), Anne Marie discovers she must overcome her fears before she can conquer the waves. Hailed as an exhilarating \u201cfun ride\u201d by People Magazine, Blue Crush is an adrenaline-powered story of heartfelt friendship and non-stop action that The Washington Post raves is \u201ca big, sexy, sun-splashed thrill.\u201dBonus Content: BD-Live BD-Live Pocket Blu Pocket Blu \n rating: 5.0 \n review: After seeing this on Netflix I sought out owning it and Blue Crush 1. I was very impressed with the stars in these films, and I particularly liked Kate Bosworth. Quite a surprise was Michelle Rodriguez. This young lady is one of the most versatile actresses I have ever seen. She plays a good warrior, (I've yet to see her in a part as a young ing\u00e9nue), and she certainly shows skill in driving and also with the jet ski. I'm convinced she did some of the surfing shown in the film herself, though Hollywood has its ways. I gave this film 5 stars and as a Blu-Ray it is quite breathtaking to see the North Shore surf. Its in good company with BC2 and the other good surfing films beginning with John Millius's (an accomplished surfer himself) \"Big Wednesday.\"-------\nItem title: Carmen \n Item description: All the passion and spectacle of Bizet's Carmen comes to life in this dazzling screen opera starring Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes-Johnson. In 19th century Seville, the lusty, tempestuous Carmen (Migenes-Johnson) seduces a naive Army corporal, Don Jose (Domingo), newly assigned to the village fortress. Jose abandons his career, his fianc\u201ae and even his dying mother for the love of this sultry gypsy. But soon she spurns him in favor of a toreador, Escamillo (Ruggero Raimondi). Crazed with jealousy, Jose begs Carmen to return to him, but her taunting declaration of independence results in tragedy. Shot entirely on location in Andalusia Spain, Bizet's Carmen has been hailed as the definitive version of this classic opera. Superbly directed by Francesco Rosi (Illustrious Corpses). NOTE: There will be silence for 20 seconds at the beginning of the movie after which you can hear audience cheering.This is made intentionally by the studio. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I had this opera for years on a VHS tape. I watched it in 1990 with a lady friend one night when she was on duty managing a group home.  She later was taken a degenerative illness but I treasured the experience of seeing her enjoyment with her first opera view. Now I was glad to have this version. Thanks.-------\nItem title: NCIS \n Item description: The 17th season of NCIS returns immediately after Ziva\u2019s (Cote de Pablo) warning to Gibbs (Mark Harmon) that his life is in danger. Gibbs will not only question Ziva\u2019s motive for her return, but why she remained underground after being presumed dead for many years. \n rating: 1.0 \n review: Some idiot has taken to cutting-off conversations mid sentence to insert breaks for commercials. Season 16 was NOT done that way. You will real quick lose me forever as any kind of subscriber to your \"sold\" seasons which should be free anyway.-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

Barrie's 'Peter Pan' and Disney's 1953 animated adaptation. In 'Tinker Bell' (2008) Tinker Bell and the other fairies must use their mystical powers to rescue their homeland Pixie Hollow after it comes under threat. In 'Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure' (2009) the fairies are excited by the promise of an extraordinary autumn fair where a blue harvest moon will enable them to heal the Pixie Dust Tree - the origin of their magic. But Tinker Bell makes a mistake during the ceremony and the magic of Pixie Hollow is endangered. In 'Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue' (2010) Tinker Bell risks life and limb to reach out to Lizzy (Lauren Mote), a human girl in need of a friend. But when Lizzy's scientist father threatens to carry out research on one of the fairies, the miniature beings come together to save all of fairykind. In 'Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings' (2012), when Tinker Bell ventures with her friends into the mysterious Winter Woods, she meets the frost fairy Periwinkle (Lucy Hale) and discovers the magical secret of the fairy wings. In 'Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy' (2014), lured by its magic powers, dust-keeper fairy Zarina (Christina Hendricks) steals the Blue Pixie Dust and joins the Skull Rock pirates who make her their captain. Without the dust Tinker Bell and her friends will lose their ability to fly. The fairies embark on a race against time to bring it back to Pixie Hollow but when Zarina switches their unique talents, their journey only becomes more challenging. In 'Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast' (2014), when animal fairy Fawn (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes friendly with a huge, hairy beast with fangs, Tinker Bell and the other fairies of Pixie Hollow have their doubts about her new acquaintance. However, with the legendary NeverBeast in danger of being captured by the Scout Fairies, Fawn must convince her friends to help her save the creature.",

Frank Darabont's second adaptation of a Stephen King prison drama ( The Shawshank Redemption was the first) is a very faithful adaptation of King's serial novel. In the middle of the Depression, Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) runs death row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary. Into this dreary world walks a mammoth prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Duncan) who, very slowly, reveals a special gift that will change the men working and dying (in the electric chair, masterfully and grippingly staged) on the mile . As with King's book, Darabont takes plenty of time to show us Edgecomb's world before delving into John Coffey's mystery. With Darabont's superior storytelling abilities, his touch for perfect casting, and a leisurely 188-minute running time, his movie brings to life nearly every character and scene from the novel.

It is, however, rich storytelling, populated with very real individuals inhabiting a very real world. The animation is problematic, sometimes appearing out of proportion or just subpar; but it seems to stem from an attempt at realism, something distinguishing the film's characters from previous, cutesy, animated animals. A band of rabbits illegally leave their warren after a prophecy of doom from a runt named Fiver (Richard Briers). In search of a place safe from humans and predators, they face all kinds of dangers, including a warren that has made a sick bargain with humankind, and a warren that is basically a fascist state. Allegories aside, Down is engaging and satisfying, and pulls off the same amazing trick that the novel did--you'll forget that this is a story about rabbits. --Keith Simanton \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I read the book before I saw the movie, and it was fairly accurate, which is more than I can say about most movies based on books. I love this movie and reccomend it to anyone, all ages. Scratch that- it has a little  violence, but nothing much, and it's just so well done! A few words in the  movie are spoken in Rabbit, so if you want to know what they mean you have  to buy the book- which you should do anyway!-------\nItem title: E.Y.E.S. of Mars VHS \n Item description: VHS Tape \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This movie was wonderful! I saw it a few years ago on the sci-fi channel, and then I stumbled upon it here and I just had to write a review. I don't care about artistic technique or what's anime and what's not, I care about  content. This had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it gives  a valuable lesson any child should learn at an early age; that it's wrong  to pollute and corrupt a planet. It's a good plot, too, about a young girl  in a school for psychics that is completely shut off from the horrors of  mars on the rest of the planet.-------\nItem title: Rikki Tikki Tavi [VHS] \n Item description: Orson Welles narrates this fine animated feature based on Rudyard Kipling's story about a brave mongoose who saves his English family from two deadly cobra snakes.

It's about a rodent (I forget what type, but I'm guessing some sort of ferret or weasel) named Rikki-Tikki-Tavi who fights snakes that are trying to bite his family of  humans. Any child should watch this movie. And please ignore the brightness  of the cover-that cover makes me wince. The animation of the movie does NOT  look like that!-------\nItem title: The Enchanted Forest VHS \n Item description: The innocence and magic of a childhood dream. The charm and adventure of a well told fairy tale. And the heartwarming thrill and human drama of a mother and child reunion. \"The Enchanted Forest\" is the captivating tale of a year old boy, lost in a vast redwood forest and saved by Old John (Harry Davenport) and his animal friends. This 1945 classic is a film no family should miss! \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I'm shocked! I look this video up and I find not even a picture of the video, and a notice that it goes in and out of print! I saw this video a thousand times, and it isn't just about a boy who learns something from an  old man- It's so much more than that!

'Flags of Our Fathers; (2006) is based on the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers. In February 1945, even as victory in Europe was finally within reach, the war in the Pacific raged on. One of the most crucial and bloodiest battles of the war was the struggle for the island of Iwo Jima, which culminated with what would become one of the most iconic images in history: five Marines and a Navy corpsman raising the American flag on Mount Suribachi. But the surviving flag raisers had no interest in being held up as symbols and did not consider themselves heroes; they wanted only to stay on the front with their brothers in arms who were fighting and dying without fanfare or glory. 'Letters from Iwo Jima' (2006) is based on the book 'Picture Letters from Commander in Chief' by Tadamichi Kuribayashi. The island of Iwo Jima stands between the American military force and the home islands of Japan. Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favour the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff.",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Nadia, The Secret of Blue Water: Perfect Collection [DVD] \n Description: Product Description The World's Fair, Paris 1889: Young inventor Jean crosses paths with an enigmatic girl named Nadia and her pet lion, King, on the run from a trio of villains attempting to stealing the Blue Water - a mysterious jewel Nadia wears around her neck. So begins a quest that will take them around the world and through many, many adventures. Amazon.com Based loosely on Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , the sci-fi-fantasy Nadia, Secret of Blue Water (1990) opens at the Paris Exposition of 1889. Jean Ratlique, a young inventor and aspiring aviator, rescues Nadia, a circus acrobat, and her lion cub King from three robbers after her mysterious blue necklace. This exciting introduction leads to adventures in exotic settings, including the South Pole, Oceana, and Africa. In addition to encountering Captain Nemo and the Nautilus , Nadia, King, and Jean visit the 12,000-year-old remains of the Atlantean Empire. Secret of Blue Water boasts an impressive pedigree: Hayao Miyazaki proposed the idea as a young animation artist, and the first 22 episodes were directed by Hideaki Anno, the creator of Neon Genesis Evangelion . It's interesting to see how Miyazaki developed the combination of a heroine of unknown origin, a mysterious gem, a young aviator, and a lost civilization more fully in Castle in the Sky , and how some of the Atlanteans' science prefigures themes in Evangelion . But the story stalls when Nadia, Jean, and their friends are shipwrecked on a tropical island: the filmmakers just mark time until the villains reappear and main plot picks up. Nadia is a rare example of a heroine of color in anime, and her fervent defense of animal rights demonstrates her unusual strength of character. But she can also seem priggish and self-righteous when she bullies Jean and berates people who've saved her life. Secret of Blue Water remains a fan favorite almost two decades after its release, as its adventurous storyline appeals to audiences of both sexes.

Amazon.com Could it be that with Hawaii Five-O \u0092s fourth season, a third of the way into its remarkable '60s-'70s run, the show has gotten... well, cool ? Actually, there are signs throughout this six-disc set of 24 digitally-remastered episodes that point to yes. Let\u0092s not get carried away here; Five-O is still basically as square as Tiananmen and Trafalgar, and as long as Steve McGarrett (portrayed, as ever, by Jack Lord) is in charge, its groove factor will never rival that of, say, CSI: Miami , or any other glossy new millennium cop drama. Indeed, the show\u0092s corniness and utter lack of irony remain integral to its charm. But there are a few interesting developments in this \u009271-\u009272 season. There\u0092s a good complement of snappy dialogue (one particularly large perp is \"so big he could go bear-hunting with chopsticks\"). And although the pacing can be pretty stodgy, the editing is a bit more deft; many scenes flow more naturally, and in at least one instance (\"I Want Some Candy, and a Gun that Shoots,\" wherein a sniper is picking off cops on a coastal highway), the entire episode is more exciting than the Five-0 norm. The direction and lighting are also more stylish, while the music (not just Morton Stevens' classic theme song but the incidental sounds as well) and location scenery, two elements that have always been among the series\u0092 strong suits, are as good as ever; in fact, the islands look so lush and inviting that one wonders why the bad guys can even get motivated to commit their dirty deeds. But they do, of course, and McGarrett and his faithful team (James MacArthur as Danno, Kam Fong as Chin Ho, and, in what remains one of the great TV credits ever, \"Zulu as Kono\") are there to stop 'em. This time around they\u0092re dealing with everything from a big money travelers check scam (\"3,000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu,\" with Jed Clampett... er, Buddy Ebsen as a guest villain), eco-terrorism (\"Is This Any Way to Run a Paradise\"), political assassination (\"Rest in Peace, Somebody\"), and racism-rape (\"Skinhead\"), along with the usual murders and encounters with Red Chinese nemesis Wo Fat (Khigh Dhiegh). McGarrett is for the most part still as stiff as his hair, but Lord occasionally displays considerable passion, as when he breaks down in tears upon being informed that a nasty car accident did not leave him paralyzed (in \"The 90-Second War,\" a two-parter). As always, bonus material is limited to brief, previous-week promos for each episode. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great follow up to season 3. High quality video with extras. Great price.-------\nItem title: The Pacific: (DVD) \n Item description: Product Description The Pacific is an epic 10-part miniseries that delivers a realistic portrait of WWII's Pacific Theatre as seen through the intertwined odysseys of three U.S. Marines - Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge. The extraordinary experiences of these men and their fellow Marines take them from the first clash with the Japanese in the haunted jungles of Guadalcanal, through the impenetrable rain firests of Cape Gloucester, across the blasted coral strongholds of Peleliu, up the black sand terraces of Iwo Jima, through the killing fields of Okinawa, to the triumphant, yet uneasy, return home after V-J Day. The viewer will be immersed in combat through the intimate perspective of this diverse, relatable group of men pushed to the limit in battle both physically and psychologically against a relentless enemy unlike any encountered before. Amazon.com Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have long since shown that they can spin a good World War II yarn. But while their previous collaborations ( Saving Private Ryan , which they starred in and directed, respectively, and Band of Brothers , for which they were part of the producing team) were set in Europe, The Pacific is their first look at the conflict with the Japanese on the other side of the world--and the two executive producers, along with an outstanding cast, an able crew, and a slew of top-notch writers and directors, have done a superb job. In making a 10-episode HBO miniseries (on five discs, with a sixth containing bonus material) that combines real events and participants with other dramatic elements newly created for the project, the filmmakers took a personal, experiential approach, focusing in particular on three marines, all of them real individuals: Robert Leckie (played by James Badge Dale), an aspiring writer who sees his first action at Guadalcanal, falls in love while on leave in Australia, and later suffers serious war wounds; John Balisone (Jon Seda), who performs heroically at Guadalcanal, earns a Medal of Honor, and is then sent home to help sell war bonds, only to return to action at Iwo Jima; and Eugene Sledge (Joseph Mazzello), who enlists later than the others, but not too late to witness and take part in some unimaginable horrors (books written by Sledge and Leckie about their experiences were used as source material for the miniseries). Of course, no one who's never been in combat can understand what it's really like, but through these three, and other men as well, we get some idea of the debilitating effects of war, both physical and psychological, and how those who managed to survive it might cope. As Leckie would write, \"There are things men can do to one another that are sobering to the soul. It is one thing to reconcile these things with God, but another to square them with yourself.\" A number of episodes depict the characters at home, on leave, or otherwise away from the field of battle, but the greatest impact comes from the extraordinarily powerful fighting scenes in which the marines--exhausted, half-starving, riddled with malaria, and enduring the appalling conditions (from extreme heat to relentless, torrential downpours) of an impenetrable, unforgiving jungle--battle an implacable, fanatical foe who would much rather die than surrender or be taken prisoner. A sequence in Part Five, when we're with Sledge as he lands at Peleliu for his first real action, is especially gripping; battles at night and in the rain at Cape Gloucester in Part Four, on Iwo Jima in Part Eight, and on Okinawa in Part Nine are also wrenching, but really, all the fighting sequences manage to convey the sheer, visceral terror the men experienced. To the filmmakers' credit, a number of real WWII veterans are on hand to share their memories, both in a 49-minute featurette on disc 6 and during the short introductions to each episode narrated by Hanks. Other extras include a 22-minute \"making of\" piece and a brief but interesting description of the cultural differences that made the conflict between the Japanese and the Americans even more brutal than it might have been. Kudos also go to the packaging and design of the boxed set; the menus are easily navigable, offering a synopsis of each episode. --Sam Graham \n rating: 4.0 \n review: If you liked Band of Brothers you will most likely enjoy this.

Sheen\u0092s Emmy Award Winning Television Programs titled, \"Life is Worth Living.\" Sheen\u0092s presence and sense of drama have crossed time and distance. His words of wit and wisdom transcend the years. His eloquence portrays the sacred truth that in every human heart there is a struggle known only to the soul and God. Actor Martin Sheen chose his name from Bishop Sheen. Pope John Paul II used Sheen's tapes to practice English. Dr. Robert Schuller writes, \"he was the first Evangelist from whom we all learned.\" Rev. Billy Graham calls Sheen \"the greatest communicator of the 20th century.\" \"We may not be able to meet in the same pew but we can all meet together on our knees in prayer.\" The Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints has approved the Petition from the Diocese of Peoria to open the canonization Cause for Fulton John Sheen. \"Christ is longing to change your life in ways more wondrous than your dreams can imagine.\" \"Bye Now and God Love You.\" -Fulton John Sheen 1895-1979 Two volumes on one DVD.

This is the Bishop at his best: in a pulpit, not a TV studio. It is a new Sheen experience seen here for the first time. The Bishop\u0092s wit and wisdom transcend the years.

Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson are the tangled twosome \"So in Love\" despite her \"I Hate Men\" flash points. Ann Miller adds heat, razzle-tap-dazzling in \"Too Darn Hot\" and wowing \"Tom, Dick and Harry\" (Bob Fosse, Tommy Rall and Bobby Van). Fosse and Hermes Pan provide zesty choreography under George Sidney's nimble direction. So \"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\" and enjoy. Kate won't just kiss you.

But the truth behind these events has been obscured by faith and time--until now. After six years of unprecedented research, host Simcha Jacobovici and a team of renowned archeologists, Egyptologists, geologists, and theologians shed revelatory new light on the Exodus and the era's ruling Egyptian Dynasty. Their new theory pushes events hundreds of years earlier than previously thought, allowing age-old stories to sparkle with new perspectives and startling historical import. Using elaborate, state-of-the-art CGI, THE EXODUS DECODED offers a stunning virtual account of stories like the birth of Moses, the ten plagues, and the parting of the Red Sea, revealing once and for all the difference between acts of Nature and the hand of God. Also included is a bonus disc that examines two pivotal figures of the Exodus--Moses and Ramses the Great--as well as the Ark of the Covenant. DVD Features: History in the Making Featurette; 3 Bonus Programs; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection Amazon.com Complex yet utterly compelling, The Exodus Decoded is presented by movie director James Cameron ( Titanic ) but is the passion of Jewish-Canadian filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici. Jacobovici has extensively researched evidence that the Biblical account of the Exodus was real, and concludes that it actually took place in 1500 BCE (during the reign of pharaoh Ahmos I), historically known as the Hyksos Expulsion. The Hyksos people were a Semitic race about whom little is known. But their departure from Egypt, following a long enslavement, along with early writings and other physical evidence, make a strong case that they are the Hebrews of lore. Jacobovici suggests the Exodus is also connected to the catastrophic eruption of the Santorini volcano, which ended the Minoan civilization and triggered a limnic eruption (a surge of carbon dioxide) in the Nile river delta. The latter would have killed the river's fish but likely chased out all the frogs, a phenomenon that could have been considered one of the famous plagues in the Exodus story. (Jacobovici makes a case for the other so-called plagues also being a consequence of the eruption.) Whatever one's opinion of The Exodus Decoded as a historical documentary, it is engrossing viewing, shot in some truly exotic locations, often under the highly suspicious eye of Egyptian authorities. Several moments--such as the revelation of a Hyksos slave's rock carving, pleading with God to be rescued--are astonishing. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Interesting-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

I saw it with my pre-teen daughter and her friend, and again with another friend and my daughter, and a third time all by myself.  I cannot really pinpoint the reason, but I was delighted by this film - in part, it had to be Amanda Bynes, who emotes terribly, but is so goofy and guileless when she does it that it is charming.  Her Sebastian was ridiculous, but in a loveable way - I giggled through the whole thing, all three times, and I have no doubt I'd laugh again upon a fourth viewing.  I really appreciate these modernizations of Shakespeare - even when they are but loosely based on the original (essentially lifting the plot).  They make Shakespeare a lot more accessible to those of us who do not want to get a headache while allegedly being entertained (my job is headache enough - I wish to be diverted by my entertainment, not goaded into deep thought by the uppity pretentions of pseudo-intellectual filmmakers).  They may also spark interest among a whole new audience - who is this Shakespeare fellow, and what's he all about, anyhow?<br /><br />There are so many fun scenes in this movie once she decides to do the girl dressing as a boy thing.  When she first gets to the school and balks at the last minute, and her friend makes her go through with it, there's some fun stuff there.  I love the scene in the restaurant when her friend helps rescue her reputation as a \"man\" with the other guys by sending in the incredible hotties to pretend to be ex girlfriends, and the character of Monique is hysterical.-------\nItem title: Boston Legal - Season One \n Item description: Product Description Led by an Emmy Award-winning cast (James Spader, Denny Crane and Candice Bergen), \"Boston Legal\" tells the professional and personal stories of a group of brilliant but often emotionally challenged attorneys. Fast-paced and darkly comedic, the series confronts social and moral issues, while its characters continually stretch the boundaries of the law. Amazon.com The classic combination of James Spader and William Shatner is just one of many reasons to savor the inaugural 17-episode season of Boston Legal . Making its highly rated ABC debut on October 3, 2004, this darkly comedic spinoff from The Practice looked like a formulaic reworking of creator David E. Kelley's previously successful series Ally McBeal , with similar plots and quirky characters enmeshed in personal and professional affairs of the heart at the prestigious Boston law firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt. It quickly became apparent that Kelley, co-executive producer Bill D'Elia, and the show's magnificent ensemble cast were onto something equally fresh, funny, and infectiously entertaining. Red Carpet Video: The Boston Legal cast gives Amazon.com some behind-the-scenes scoop and recommends their favorite DVDs and music. High | Low Both Shatner and Spader won Emmys for their original roles on The Practice , and the priceless pairing of the erratic, egomaniacal senior partner Denny Crane (Shatner, doing the best work of his career) and ethically challenged attorney Alan Shore (Spader, likewise) signaled the arrival of one of the finest comedic duos in TV history. Waging a two-man war on political correctness, the boisterous has-been Denny loves the sound of his own name (the mere mention of \"Denny Crane\" qualifies as ego-stroking foreplay), unabashedly subjects female associates to his lascivious advances, and (in creator Kelley's words) \"trades on the currency of his reputation\" as an undefeated trial attorney. As the show's fascinating heart and soul, Alan Shore is a walking contradiction, and Spader plays him perfectly as a charismatic, self-loathing lothario who'll bend the law to suit his higher purposes. Deeply cynical yet fiercely committed to his own complex and compassionate moral code, he's brazenly open about his sexual appetites as he savors the affections of smart, sexy associates Sally Heep (Lake Bell), and Tara Wilson (Rhona Mitra), whose relationship with Shore grows strained as the season progresses. While senior partner Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois), senior associate and ex-Marine Brad Chase (Mark Valley), and junior associate Lori Colson (Monica Potter) struggle to maintain the firm's lofty reputation, the appearance of founding partner Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen) elevates Boston Legal to an even higher plane of serio-comic perfection. A former flame of Denny Crane's, Schmidt arrives in episode 11 (appropriately titled \"Schmidt Happens\") as common-sense negotiator with a rapier wit and a clanking pair of big brass cojones, fully capable of holding her own against the Crane/Shore juggernaut. And while \"An Eye for an Eye\" (episode 5) is a sublime example of Boston Legal's deft combination of lunacy and courtroom complexity, it's the deeper implications of episodes like \"Tortured Souls\" (15) and season finale \"Death Be Not Proud\" (tackling a dubious death sentence in Texas) that cast these rich and wonderful characters into sharper relief, baring their souls and the courage of their convictions. With surprising departures (Lake Bell, in episode 13), new arrivals (Kerry Washington, as new associate Chelina Hall, in episode 15) and stellar guest stars including Larry Miller (as the eccentrically unstable founding partner Edwin Poole), Philip Baker Hall, Frances Fisher, Carl Reiner, Freddie Prinze Jr., Shelley Long, and late-season regular Betty White, Boston Legal gained a large and loyal following with exceptional writing, timely social relevance, and that rare quality of chemistry that guarantees long-term appeal. Nowhere is this more apparent than the now-famous Spader/Shatner \"balcony scenes\" that quickly became an episode-closing tradition, with staunch Republican Denny Crane and passionate Democrat Alan Shore reflecting upon their careers, current issues, and their own devoted friendship over brandy and cigars. With these two actors together, virtually every episode ends on a high note of pensive introspection, and Boston Legal becomes even greater than the sum of its parts. DVD extras are minimal (two featurettes with cast and producers, plus deleted scenes from episode 1) but enjoyably worthwhile. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I love this show. I have been trying to get it on youtube or netflix for free, but it's not there, so I finally caved and bought all 5 seasons. Pretty cheap on amazon.

Fast-paced and darkly comedic, the series confronts social and moral issues, while its characters continually stretch the boundaries of the law. Amazon.com The classic combination of James Spader and William Shatner is just one of many reasons to savor the inaugural 17-episode season of Boston Legal . Making its highly rated ABC debut on October 3, 2004, this darkly comedic spinoff from The Practice looked like a formulaic reworking of creator David E. Kelley's previously successful series Ally McBeal , with similar plots and quirky characters enmeshed in personal and professional affairs of the heart at the prestigious Boston law firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt. It quickly became apparent that Kelley, co-executive producer Bill D'Elia, and the show's magnificent ensemble cast were onto something equally fresh, funny, and infectiously entertaining. Red Carpet Video: The Boston Legal cast gives Amazon.com some behind-the-scenes scoop and recommends their favorite DVDs and music. High | Low Both Shatner and Spader won Emmys for their original roles on The Practice , and the priceless pairing of the erratic, egomaniacal senior partner Denny Crane (Shatner, doing the best work of his career) and ethically challenged attorney Alan Shore (Spader, likewise) signaled the arrival of one of the finest comedic duos in TV history. Waging a two-man war on political correctness, the boisterous has-been Denny loves the sound of his own name (the mere mention of \"Denny Crane\" qualifies as ego-stroking foreplay), unabashedly subjects female associates to his lascivious advances, and (in creator Kelley's words) \"trades on the currency of his reputation\" as an undefeated trial attorney. As the show's fascinating heart and soul, Alan Shore is a walking contradiction, and Spader plays him perfectly as a charismatic, self-loathing lothario who'll bend the law to suit his higher purposes. Deeply cynical yet fiercely committed to his own complex and compassionate moral code, he's brazenly open about his sexual appetites as he savors the affections of smart, sexy associates Sally Heep (Lake Bell), and Tara Wilson (Rhona Mitra), whose relationship with Shore grows strained as the season progresses. While senior partner Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois), senior associate and ex-Marine Brad Chase (Mark Valley), and junior associate Lori Colson (Monica Potter) struggle to maintain the firm's lofty reputation, the appearance of founding partner Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen) elevates Boston Legal to an even higher plane of serio-comic perfection. A former flame of Denny Crane's, Schmidt arrives in episode 11 (appropriately titled \"Schmidt Happens\") as common-sense negotiator with a rapier wit and a clanking pair of big brass cojones, fully capable of holding her own against the Crane/Shore juggernaut. And while \"An Eye for an Eye\" (episode 5) is a sublime example of Boston Legal's deft combination of lunacy and courtroom complexity, it's the deeper implications of episodes like \"Tortured Souls\" (15) and season finale \"Death Be Not Proud\" (tackling a dubious death sentence in Texas) that cast these rich and wonderful characters into sharper relief, baring their souls and the courage of their convictions. With surprising departures (Lake Bell, in episode 13), new arrivals (Kerry Washington, as new associate Chelina Hall, in episode 15) and stellar guest stars including Larry Miller (as the eccentrically unstable founding partner Edwin Poole), Philip Baker Hall, Frances Fisher, Carl Reiner, Freddie Prinze Jr., Shelley Long, and late-season regular Betty White, Boston Legal gained a large and loyal following with exceptional writing, timely social relevance, and that rare quality of chemistry that guarantees long-term appeal. Nowhere is this more apparent than the now-famous Spader/Shatner \"balcony scenes\" that quickly became an episode-closing tradition, with staunch Republican Denny Crane and passionate Democrat Alan Shore reflecting upon their careers, current issues, and their own devoted friendship over brandy and cigars. With these two actors together, virtually every episode ends on a high note of pensive introspection, and Boston Legal becomes even greater than the sum of its parts. DVD extras are minimal (two featurettes with cast and producers, plus deleted scenes from episode 1) but enjoyably worthwhile. --Jeff Shannon  rating: 5.0  review: I love this show. I have been trying to get it on youtube or netflix for free, but it's not there, so I finally caved and bought all 5 seasons. Pretty cheap on amazon. Watched 5 episodes with my husband, and it was just as good as I remembered.  He was a first time viewer, and he really liked it - said it was the best lawyer show he'd ever seen.-------Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Castle: Season 3 \n Description: Product Description Famous mystery novelist Richard Castle and NYPD Detective Kate Beckett return for the suspenseful Third Season of ABC's brilliantly funny series, CASTLE. Enjoy every inspired idea and flirtatious moment as this fiery duo solve the strangest homicides New York has to offer. It's the most entertaining season yet as Castle's wildly funny storytelling skills work their way into every case. Between his mixed-up partnership with Beckett and his relationships with his diva mother and his clever daughter, Alexis, Castle is always on his toes. Crime fighting has never been this much fun! Get on the beat and relive every wild and witty moment in this 5-disc DVD set. Amazon.com Castle continues its strong run through its third season, mixing the grim work of the New York Police Department's homicide investigations with a light touch of humor based in its characters. The cast remains essentially the same: bestselling novelist Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion), who shadows Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) as research for his character Nikki Heat; bromantic detective partners Ryan (Seamus Dever) and Esposito (Jon Huertas), Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), and medical examiner Lainie (Tamala Jones); and Castle's mother (Susan Sullivan) and daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn). And while romance develops for a number of them, Castle and Beckett continue their interplay of flirtation mixed with exasperation. Add another character to the mix: the city of New York, which reveals its many sides--Central Park, the subway system, the bar and steampunk subcultures--in many of the weekly murders. Castle might be best epitomized in consecutive midseason episodes: in the first, Laura Prepon guest-stars as actress Natalie Rhodes, who has been cast to play the big-screen version of Nikki Heat, and the cast's differing and revolving reactions to her are very funny. The following episode ratchets up the intensity in the newest development in the search for the killer of Beckett's mother. There's also a notable two-parter in which Castle and Beckett are trapped in a freezer as they try to find a dirty bomb somewhere in the city. Other guest stars include Lance Henriksen as an alien-abduction expert, Corbin Bernsen as a soap-opera star, Jane Seymour as a soap writer's mom, Adrian Pasdar as a Homeland Security agent, Bruce Davison as the DA, Michael McKean as a beauty-pageant sponsor, and Gene Simmons as himself. Also appearing are mystery writers Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly, who leave an empty place at Castle's poker table for the late Stephen J. Cannell. The core of the show, of course, is Castle and Beckett, from the opening of the season when Castle hasn't called or visited the department in months, to Beckett's complicated relationships with her original training officer, Royce (Jason Beghe), or her perpetually absent boyfriend. Then not long after one breathless moment in which it seems \"Casckett\" might become a reality, things come to a head in the season-ending cliffhanger. --David Horiuchi",

Because of its implacable-revenge motif, and its extended training sequences, this is sometimes cited as the first true martial arts movie--a transitional film between the old-school swordplay and the contemporary kung fu genres. Whatever you call it, it is easily one of the most influential Asian action movies ever made. A master of long-sword fighting techniques, Wang loses an arm in the early innings. (It is hacked off by the woman he loves.) In order to exact payback, he has to master the unfamiliar short-sword style, using the stump of his symbolically shattered blade. Meanwhile, enemies of the long-sword school have invented a sneaky \"sword-clamp\" device and deploy it against the good guys. Issues of fighting style and discipline are central; one technique trumps another, and the hero triumphs because, driven by rage, he practices more obsessively than his foes. This is a lean, effective piece of genre craftsmanship from the great director Chang Cheh, finally available in the U.S. in a letterboxed version that gives his shapely widescreen compositions a fair shake. --David Chute \n rating: 5.0 \n review: nice I LIKED-------\nItem title: Painted Skin: The Resurrection \n Item description: Product Description According to ancient lore a 1000 year old female demon monster transforms into a beautiful seductress consuming living human hearts for a chance to become human.

Review A robust Chinese war epic -VarietyA Bloody tale of honour, revenge and sacrifice -SBS FilmSolid and earnest entertainment -LoveHKFilm About the Actor Ekin Cheng Yee-Kin is a Hong Kong actor and Cantopop singer. Earlier in his career he was known as Noodle Cheng, though he has now reverted to a more conventional-sounding first name. Sometimes he uses Dior (because that was what it sounded like when his younger sister tried to call him) as a first name but usually Ekin is the name used. Ekin began acting in commercials when he was in high school, the most well-known being for Hi-C Lemon Tea. After high school, he enrolled in TVB's Martial Arts school, but did not like it and switched to their acting school. After that he began to get a number of TV roles. The latest TVB series he participated in was Always Ready, working with Charmaine Sheh, Bowie Lam, and Ka-Yan Chung. Ekin was caught up in a grand scandal after leaving Maggie Siu, an actress whom he dated for many years, for a decade younger actress and singer Gigi Leung. Maggie was well-loved by Hong Kong audiences and gave up her career to support Ekin's career and many slighted him after the breakup. In 2006, Ekin and Gigi broke up, ending their seven-year relationship. In September 2006, Ekin and 'Yoyo Mung' begun dating through their mutual interest in badminton. His first film was Girls Without Tomorrow (1992) and at the time he was still going by the name Dior Cheng. He changed his name to Ekin before his breakout role in the Young and Dangerous series as Chan Ho Nam. The film led to 6 sequels, all starring Ekin Cheng, and a lucrative working partnership with director Andrew Lau. Together they went on to make The Storm Riders, which was the highest-grossing Hong Kong movie at the time and the first film to utilize a truly large number of special effects. They also worked together on The Legend of Speed, A Man Called Hero, The Duel and the comedy Women From Mars. Ekin has branched out in the roles he's taken, including more comedy like earlier in his career with My Wife is 18 and Six Strong Guys, while still doing more action-oriented films like The Twins Effect and Tokyo Raiders. Recently Ekin returned to the movie scene (having taking a break in 2005 to work on the Ultraman TV Series in Thailand), He had a brief appearance in My Name is Fame as himself. Soon after that he starred in Heavenly Mission a triad/cop thriller starring alongside Stephen Fung &amp; Alex Fong. He has completed a Pang Brothers film called The Forest of Death, which will be released in March 2007. He is currently filming a serial in Mainland China based on the life of martial arts master, Huo Yuanjia with former Young &amp; Dangerous co-star Jordan Chan. About the Director Born in Hong Kong, Ronny Yan-Tai Yu dreamed of making films since he was a child. At only 9 months of age, Yu contracted polio, resulting in a long recovery that prevented him from developing an active childhood and had to spend much time in isolation. To cope with the loneliness, Yu created fantasy worlds of his own, with furniture as props. As he grew older, his world of escape became the cinema, where he could immerse in grander, more exciting adventures. It was then that his passion to become a director began to grow. However, as the only son of a traditional Chinese family, film making was cast aside by the time he started college. Under pressure to take up the family business, Yu studied business instead and earned an MBA from Ohio University. Soon after graduation, a pivotal turning point occurred for Yu. His friend Philip Chan, a police lieutenant with acting ambitions, persuaded Yu to direct The Servant, a screenplay that he wrote based on his experiences in the police force. Yu took up the opportunity and learned the craft as the filming proceeded. The film became the No.1 box office hit for the summer, and Yu's future seemed destined to be in film after all. Throughout the 1980s Yu directed and produced many other box office successes in Hong Kong. In 1993, the romantic swordplay epic The Bride with White Hair (The Bride with White Hair) established his signature style of kinetically-paced story-telling through sumptuous imagery. Bride was a huge summer hit in Hong Kong, and also became an art house theater favorite in the U.S. and Europe, leading to international critical acclaim. It also won the Grand Prize at the Fantastica film festival in Belgium. In 1995 came the equally ravishing Ye ban ge sheng (The Phantom Lover), a love story inspired by the original novel of The Phantom of the Opera, and the Chinese movie Songs of Midnight from the 1920s. Following these two stunning films, Yu launched his Hollywood career. His flair for visually rich narration appealed immediately to broader Western audiences and has been associated mostly with the horror film genre, as he has revived three franchises - with Bride of Chucky; then Freddy vs. Jason, of the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th franchises, respectively, where its box office total is more than the two franchises'combined earnings. Never one who confines himself to a genre, Yu went on to direct Fearless (Fearless), a film starring Jet Li, based on the true story of the martial arts master Huo Yuanjia.

Amazon.com Tackling William Shakespeare's Hamlet, director Xiaogang Feng presents a unique take on the bard's famous play with the action drama Legend of the Black Scorpion , which is beautifully filmed and well acted. Ziyi Zhang stars as Empress Wan, a conniving woman whose beauty is equaled by her taste for power. She lustfully longs for her stepson Wu Lan (Daniel Wu). But when the Emperor dies, it is Wu Lan's younger brother who ascends to the throne, setting off a chain of events that are tragic. Though the story is familiar, the presentation is anything but; just as Hamlet captivated readers with its tale of lust, greed, and betrayal, Legend of the Black Scorpion draws viewers in with a story that is both fascinating and repulsive, but shot so beautifully that the eyes are drawn to the screen. Legendary fight choreographer Woo-ping Yuen ( Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon , the Matrix trilogy) orchestrates some beautifully fierce aerial battles that while no longer novel are still thrilling to watch. We are used to seeing Zhang in the wide-eyed ing\u00e9nue roles.

Because of its implacable-revenge motif, and its extended training sequences, this is sometimes cited as the first true martial arts movie--a transitional film between the old-school swordplay and the contemporary kung fu genres. Whatever you call it, it is easily one of the most influential Asian action movies ever made. A master of long-sword fighting techniques, Wang loses an arm in the early innings. (It is hacked off by the woman he loves.) In order to exact payback, he has to master the unfamiliar short-sword style, using the stump of his symbolically shattered blade. Meanwhile, enemies of the long-sword school have invented a sneaky \"sword-clamp\" device and deploy it against the good guys. Issues of fighting style and discipline are central; one technique trumps another, and the hero triumphs because, driven by rage, he practices more obsessively than his foes. This is a lean, effective piece of genre craftsmanship from the great director Chang Cheh, finally available in the U.S. in a letterboxed version that gives his shapely widescreen compositions a fair shake. --David Chute \n rating: 5.0 \n review: nice I LIKED-------\nItem title: Painted Skin: The Resurrection \n Item description: Product Description According to ancient lore a 1000 year old female demon monster transforms into a beautiful seductress consuming living human hearts for a chance to become human.

Review A robust Chinese war epic -VarietyA Bloody tale of honour, revenge and sacrifice -SBS FilmSolid and earnest entertainment -LoveHKFilm About the Actor Ekin Cheng Yee-Kin is a Hong Kong actor and Cantopop singer. Earlier in his career he was known as Noodle Cheng, though he has now reverted to a more conventional-sounding first name. Sometimes he uses Dior (because that was what it sounded like when his younger sister tried to call him) as a first name but usually Ekin is the name used. Ekin began acting in commercials when he was in high school, the most well-known being for Hi-C Lemon Tea. After high school, he enrolled in TVB's Martial Arts school, but did not like it and switched to their acting school. After that he began to get a number of TV roles. The latest TVB series he participated in was Always Ready, working with Charmaine Sheh, Bowie Lam, and Ka-Yan Chung. Ekin was caught up in a grand scandal after leaving Maggie Siu, an actress whom he dated for many years, for a decade younger actress and singer Gigi Leung. Maggie was well-loved by Hong Kong audiences and gave up her career to support Ekin's career and many slighted him after the breakup. In 2006, Ekin and Gigi broke up, ending their seven-year relationship. In September 2006, Ekin and 'Yoyo Mung' begun dating through their mutual interest in badminton. His first film was Girls Without Tomorrow (1992) and at the time he was still going by the name Dior Cheng.

Kirk helmed the famous starship of the same name, ENTERPRISE takes place in an era when interstellar travel is still in its infancy. Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) has assembled a crew of brave explorers to chart the galaxy on a revolutionary spacecraft: Enterprise NX-01. As the first human beings to venture into deep space, these pioneers will experience the wonder and mystery of the final frontier as they seek out new life and new civilizations. Amazon.com Under intense scrutiny, the debut season of Enterprise earned a passing grade from critics and Star Trek fans alike. Voyager ended its seven-season run just four months earlier, and fans were skeptical when Enterprise premiered (on Sept. 26, 2001, on UPN) with a theme song (\"Where My Heart Will Take Me,\" composed by Diane Warren and performed by Russell Watson) that defied Trek 's revered theme-music tradition. This and other early reservations were dispelled when \"Broken Bow\" got the series off to a satisfying start, beginning in the year 2151 and establishing a pre-Federation focus on humanity's delicate relationship with the Vulcans, the controversial launch of the NX-01 Enterprise on an exploratory mission, and the potentially devastating consequences of the mysterious Temporal Cold War involving a time-traveling splinter group of the Suliban, a nomadic alien race. While establishing a testy relationship between Enterprise Capt. Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and his smart-and-sexy Vulcan Sub-Commander, T'Pol (Jolene Blalock, in a short-banged wig and form-fitting \"catsuit\" that were later redesigned), the series introduced engineer \"Trip\" Tucker (Connor Trineer), whose surprise development in \"Unexpected\" made him a fan favorite; communications officer Hoshi Sato (Linda Park); helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery); weapons expert Lt. Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating), and chief surgeon Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), a well-mannered Denobulan recruit from Earth's Interspecies Medical Exchange. As a \"prequel' series that predates the original Star Trek by 150 years, Enterprise built upon established Trek lore with episodes involving Vulcans (\"Breaking the Ice\"), Klingons (\"Sleeping Dogs\"), the blue-skinned Andorians (\"The Andorian Incident,\" \"Shadows of P'Jem\"), and the Ferengi (\"Acquisition\") while offering stand-alone episodes (notably \"Dear Doctor,\" \"Fortunate Son,\" and \"Shuttlepod One\") that further acquainted fans with the Enterprise regulars. Early Trek technology is also introduced (including \"phase pistols\" and the rarely used, still-risky transporter), and the series drew strength from what many felt would be its primary weakness: unwritten history and the initial indecisiveness of Archer's bold foray into the unknown. Ending with a dazzling \"Shock Wave\" cliffhanger that leaves Archer stranded in a decimated Temporal Cold War future, Enterprise set a strong foundation for the events of season 2. The bonus features included on the Enterprise: Season One DVDs are almost worth the price of the set, if only to see nearly nine minutes of hilarious outtakes, maintaining a beloved tradition of Star Trek bloopers. The sight (and sound) of Jolene Blalock laughing out of character is pure gold, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that Blalock is just as smart as she is sexy, as proven by her astute observations (along with the rest of the Enterprise cast) in the \"Cast Impressions\" featurette. It's the usual complimentary fluff included with all Trek sets, but it's obviously sincere, confirming fans' conviction that Enterprise should have lasted beyond four seasons with this close-knit ensemble. Series creators Brannon Braga and Rick Berman deliver a typically dry commentary on \"Broken Bow,\" setting the record straight on debate over the show's \"not retro enough\" production design (as Braga notes, \"you can never please everyone\") while defining their concept of \" The Right Stuff of Star Trek .\" As always, Mike Okuda's text commentaries offer a wealth of Trek trivia and detail from Trek 's historical canon. Fans will love the \"Enterprise Secrets\" revealing low-tech solutions to lighting the warp core and dispensing \"replicator\" beverages, along with an entertaining profile of Vaughan \"Admiral Forrest\" Armstrong, who holds the record for Trek guest appearances. The other featurettes are perfunctory, but \"Creating Enterprise \" provides valuable first-season perspective, and the \"Time Travel\" feature offers a handy reference for the many time-travel episodes from every Trek series. As usual, Easter eggs (three of them, titled \"NX-01 Files\") are hidden on the special-features menu, offering short interview clips culled from the primary featurettes. The deleted scenes demonstrate how non-essential material can be sacrificed, and because they don't include post-production sound or visual effects, fans can see and hear the actual soundstage atmosphere of Enterprise 's principal photography. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 1.0 \n review: Okay, it may be a year since I ordered this but I bought it for a very good friend in NY for Christmas last year.

Thumbs down-------\nItem title: 42: The Jackie Robinson Story \n Item description: Product Description 42 (DVD) Hero is a word we often hear in the world of sports, but heroism is not always about achievements on the field of play. 42 tells the story of two men -- the great Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) and the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) -- whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball. In 1946, Rickey signed Robinson to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. Facing racism from every side, Robinson demonstrated tremendous courage by letting his talent on the field do the talking -- ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, and paving the way for others to follow. ]]> Amazon.com 42 is a powerful film about how one man changed baseball\u2026 and changed America. The film opens in 1945, after the end of World War II, when team executive Branch Rickey has set his mind on bringing the first black baseball player into the ranks of an American major league baseball team despite the disapproval of his advisers and team manager. A stubborn man who declares that money is green, not black or white, and claims profit as his motivation, Rickey carefully selects Jackie Robinson from the Kansas City Monarchs. He chooses Robinson both because he's an excellent baseball player and because Rickey believes him to be a man with the inner strength to withstand the bullying and abuse that's sure to follow his appointment to an all-white team. So begins an emotionally charged journey of prejudice, abuse, growth, and empowerment that follows player and manager as they submerge themselves in something much bigger than themselves. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Mr. Rickey, a stubborn man with a mission he refuses to be dissuaded from and who is contradictorily harsh and kind, wise and comical, progressive and old school. Chadwick Boseman, as Jackie Robinson, exudes the intense inner strength and barely contained rage of a black man whose physical and moral strengths are ignored by fellow players and a public fixated on the color of his skin. He is absolutely believable as a man who changed the world while refusing to let the world change him. Equally strong performances are given by Nicole Beharie as the ever-calm Mrs. Rachel Robinson and Andre Holland as Wendell Smith, the black reporter who accompanies Jackie Robinson almost everywhere. 42 is a poignant film that has some unexpectedly witty moments, and viewers can expect their emotions to run the gamut from shame, helplessness, and rage to the awakening of inspiration and empowerment to continue to effect change and eradicate discrimination. 42 is one of the best films produced in a long time. Watch it--and make sure to include your teenagers in the audience. (Ages 12 and older) --Tami Horiuchi Review Boseman is watchful, winning and confident, but never saintly. Yet he keeps Robinson's moral spine aligned with his skill and self respect, showing how he needed all of those to succeed. --Joe Neumaier, New York Daily News42 persists in entertaining you, even when you're cringing, because the real story is so compelling. --Connie Ogie, Maimi HeraldA daily struggle for dignity, is impossibly moving. --Joshua Rothkopf, Time out New York See more \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great portrayal of civil rights era, you will love it if you love the sport!!-------\nItem title: Tennessee Whiskey: The Dean Dillon Story \n Item description: A legend in Nashville, Dean finally comes out of the shadows and shares his music, his life, and the stories behind the hits in this honest film about a man responsible for songs that shaped an era. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Fantastic documentary!-------\nItem title: Sand Castles \n Item description: In rural Indiana, the Daly family wrestles with the mysterious return of Lauren, a daughter kidnapped over a decade ago while her brother Noah was supposed to be watching her.

A real-life horse-whisperer, he eschews the violence of his upbringing and teaches people to communicate with their horses through leadership and sensitivity, not punishment. Buck possesses near magical abilities as he dramatically transforms horses - and people - with his understanding, compassion and respect. A truly American story about an unsung hero and one of the most successful documentaries of the year, BUCK is about an ordinary man who has made an extraordinary life despite tremendous odds. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is an incredible documentary!

Rupert Penry-Jones, as wily agent Adam Carter (intoduced last season), comfortably takes the lead while some fresh faces (like Anna Chancellor, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ) fill out the solid continuing supporting cast.

All ten episodes of the fourth series of MI-5 (known as Spooks in the U.K.) mix high-tension plots with thorny political debate--is torture justifiable to save lives? Can dirty tricks be used for democratic ends? Naturally, since our heroes are the agency, the show comes down on their side...but enough shades of gray exist to give the show some intelligent bite. When it turns out an innocent man has been imprisoned for two years, has his imprisonment turned him into the terrorist he didn't used to be? Combine this with crisp dialogue, tense performances, and moments of inspired direction (like the gripping gunfight lit almost exclusively by muzzle flashes) and you've got a top-notch spy series. The extras are few but include interviews with actors, directors, and producers. --Bret Fetzer \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Wife and I fell in love with this show, and the fourth season is just as enjoyable as the previous three.-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

Unfortunately, the only way that they are going to see their beloved swamp again is if they are able to find the rightful heir to the throne and return him to Far, Far Away. Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set off to locate the heir while Fiona holds off a coup d'etat being spearheaded by Prince Charming. Amazon.com It's not easy being an ogre, but Shrek finds it doubly difficult for an ogre like himself to fill in for a king when his father-in-law King Harold of Far, Far Away falls ill in this third Shrek movie. Shrek's attempts to fulfill his kingly duties play like a blooper reel, with boat christenings and knighting ceremonies gone terribly wrong, and to say that Shrek (Mike Myers) is insecure about his new role is a gross understatement. When King Harold (John Cleese) passes away, Shrek sets out with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find Arthur (Justin Timberlake), the only heir in line for the throne besides himself. Just as Shrek sets sail to find Artie (as Arthur is more commonly known), Fiona (Cameron Diaz) shocks Shrek with the news that she's pregnant. Soon after, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) sends Captain Hook (Ian McShane) in pursuit of Shrek and imprisons Fiona and her fellow Princesses as part of his plan to install himself as King of Far, Far Away. Shrek finds an awkward Artie jousting with his high school classmate Lancelot (John Krasinski) and, while Artie is certainly no picture of kingliness, Shrek is determined to drag him back to Far, Far Away to assume the throne. Mishaps and comedy abound, including a spell gone wrong that locks Donkey and Puss-in-Boots inside one another's bodies. While Fiona and the other Princesses prove they're anything but helpless women, Artie and Shrek battle their own fears of inadequacy in a struggle to discover their own self-worth. In the end, Shrek, Artie, and Fiona each learn a lot about their individual strengths and what truly makes each of them happy. Of course, it's the pervasive humor and wit that make Shrek the Third so side-splittingly appealing. Rated PG for some crude and suggestive humor, but appropriate for most families with children ages 6 and older. -- Tami Horiuchi Beyond Shrek The Third The Shrek Trilogy The Soundtrack Visit the Dreamworks Store Stills from Shrek The Third (click for larger image) \n rating: 4.0 \n review: was ok but the hype was the kids and they didn't show till the very end-------\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Burn! \n Description: A Caribbean island in the mid-1800's. Nature has made it a paradise; man has made it a hell. Slaves on vast Portuguese sugar plantations are ready to turn their misery into rebellion - and the British are ready to provide the spark. They send agent William Walker (Marlon Brando) on a devious three-part mission: trick the slaves into revolt, grab the sugar trade for England...then return the slaves to servitude. Gillo Pontecorvo, the acclaimed director of The Battle of Algiers, explores colonialism and insurrection in the searing epic Burn!. Both visually and narratively stunning, Burn! glows with the fires of Pontecorvo's unique filmmaking genius. Genius is also evident in Brando's complex, intelligent portrayal of a man who is both gentleman and scoundrel, revolutionary and colonialist. And Ennio Morricone's (The Untouchables, The Mission) haunting music memorably underscores the almost overwhelmingly powerful story.",

Gibbs is aided by homicide detective Anthony Dinozzo (Michael Weatherly), forensic scientist Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (Davi McCallum), computer expert Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), and department head Jennifer Shepard (Lauren Holly).

Amazon.com Describing season four of NCIS as \"the season of secrets,\" executive producer Shane Brennan suggests that season five (offered here with 18 episodes, including a two-part finale, on five discs) is \"the season of answers.\" For the most part, that's true--but at season's end, loyal viewers are likely to be thrown for a loop by the death of a major character and a startling set of changes bound to have a profound effect on the show's future. Picking up where the previous year left off, this new batch jumps right in with a continuation of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and company's pursuit of notorious international arms dealer La Grenouille (\"The Frog,\" played by Armand Assante), whom NCIS director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) is particularly keen on taking down--a quest that's complicated by the fact that the bad guy is a CIA asset, and by Agent Anthony DiNozzo's (Michael Weatherly) love affair with La Grenouille's daughter. That storyline, barely touched on thereafter, is resolved in the 14th episode, \"Internal Affairs.\" Meanwhile, the NCIS crew is distracted by an array of other cases, most of them involving murder. Of particular interest are several episodes related to Iraq and the War on Terror: a Naval officer of Syrian descent who's suspected of being an Al Qaeda mole is murdered seconds after Gibbs talks him out of jumping off a building ledge; a Marine who's having a violent bout of post-traumatic stress after returning from the Mideast turns out to be far worse off than that; Medical Examiner Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum) refuses to conduct an autopsy because of the deceased's Muslim beliefs. There's no doubt that NCIS is slick, entertaining prime-time television in every respect: writing, acting, production values, music, and so on. Still, one's appreciation of the show largely depends on the characters' likeability, and that's very much a matter of taste. Gibbs may be a chick magnet, with four former wives and a past relationship with Shepard to prove it, but he's also a taciturn fellow with horrible social skills. DiNozzo's funny and insouciant, but his smugness and incessant razzing of computer nerd Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) soon becomes tiresome, while Shepard is steely and simply unlikeable (the most appealing characters are arguably McCallum's Mallard and Pauley Perrette's mouthy Abby Sciuto, the goth-like forensic expert).

But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec, stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in the Big Apple. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: We really liked it.  It's a movie about all sorts of different relationships.  All of the characters are great.  The Keira Knightly character is sort of a guardian angel, without being at all saccharin.

Seasons One & Two (DVD) (FS) THE CANINE CRIMEBUSTER\u2019S FIRST TWO SEASONS! Could a cowardly Great Dane with a penchant for blundering through scary situations become a candidate for generations spanning stardom? It\u2019s no mystery: Scooby-Doo\u2019s popularity endures-from Saturday morning TV origins to hit live-action movies. The whodunit format was a daring new frontier for an animated series, but the members of the Mystery Inc. team, hipsterish Shaggy, brainy tomboy Velma, bold and beautiful Daphne and heroic and handsome Fred, have grown to become authentic popular-culture icons. To solve their newest mystery, finding the most awesome Scooby-Doo DVD ever, with 25 vintage episodes you need only follow this simple clue: YOU\u2019RE HOLDING IT! ]]> Amazon.com Chuck Jones and other great studio animators sneered at the cheap look and lazy craftsmanship of Hanna Barbera's television cartoons in the 1960s, but there's no question HB's original, 35-year-old Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! is enduringly beloved. The Complete First and Second Seasons includes all 25 stories first broadcast from September '69 to October '71, a growth period in which canine hero Scooby's voice (by Don Messick, who also voiced The Jetsons 's pup, Astro) was gradually refined from murky garble to Scoob's more familiar, \"Rrroowwrr\"-inflected, human-like speech. This set also represents the pre-frills Scooby-Doo : no guest appearances by Don Knotts or Batman, no Scrappy-Doo--just adventure and occasional bubblegum pop tunes by Danny Janssen and sundry co-writers (e.g., \"Pretty Mary Sunlite\" in the episode \"Don't Fool with a Phantom\"). Watching all the shows back-to-back reveals evolving complexity in the scripts. Over time, Scooby-Doo 's creators added multiple bad guys in cahoots with major villains, and developed sub-plots, backstories, and even appealing allies and friends of Mystery, Inc., a traveling band of young debunkers of supernatural phenomena. Riding around in their psychedelic Mystery Van, preppie leader Fred and his friends--haughty Daphne, brainy Velma, quasi-hippie Shaggy, and Shaggy's best pal, Scooby, an excitable Great Dane--chase down and are chased by alleged ghouls who generally turn out to be venal humans running various scams. Included here is Scooby-Doo 's premiere, \"What a Night for a Knight,\" in which the gang looks into the disappearance of a noted archaeologist and end up in a \"haunted\" museum. The fun \"Go Away Ghost Ship\" finds our heroes helping a shipping company daunted by the apparent ghost of pirate Red Beard, while the silly classic \"A Tiki Scare Is No Fair\" concerns a Hawaiian vacation for Mystery, Inc. disrupted by a witch doctor. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Excellent cartoons & quality viewing-------\nItem title: Speed (Widescreen Edition) [DVD] \n Item description: Single disc \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Nice movie-------\nItem title: Escape from New York \n Item description: Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef.

Seasons One & Two (DVD) (FS) THE CANINE CRIMEBUSTER\u2019S FIRST TWO SEASONS! Could a cowardly Great Dane with a penchant for blundering through scary situations become a candidate for generations spanning stardom? It\u2019s no mystery: Scooby-Doo\u2019s popularity endures-from Saturday morning TV origins to hit live-action movies. The whodunit format was a daring new frontier for an animated series, but the members of the Mystery Inc. team, hipsterish Shaggy, brainy tomboy Velma, bold and beautiful Daphne and heroic and handsome Fred, have grown to become authentic popular-culture icons. To solve their newest mystery, finding the most awesome Scooby-Doo DVD ever, with 25 vintage episodes you need only follow this simple clue: YOU\u2019RE HOLDING IT! ]]> Amazon.com Chuck Jones and other great studio animators sneered at the cheap look and lazy craftsmanship of Hanna Barbera's television cartoons in the 1960s, but there's no question HB's original, 35-year-old Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! is enduringly beloved. The Complete First and Second Seasons includes all 25 stories first broadcast from September '69 to October '71, a growth period in which canine hero Scooby's voice (by Don Messick, who also voiced The Jetsons 's pup, Astro) was gradually refined from murky garble to Scoob's more familiar, \"Rrroowwrr\"-inflected, human-like speech. This set also represents the pre-frills Scooby-Doo : no guest appearances by Don Knotts or Batman, no Scrappy-Doo--just adventure and occasional bubblegum pop tunes by Danny Janssen and sundry co-writers (e.g., \"Pretty Mary Sunlite\" in the episode \"Don't Fool with a Phantom\"). Watching all the shows back-to-back reveals evolving complexity in the scripts. Over time, Scooby-Doo 's creators added multiple bad guys in cahoots with major villains, and developed sub-plots, backstories, and even appealing allies and friends of Mystery, Inc., a traveling band of young debunkers of supernatural phenomena. Riding around in their psychedelic Mystery Van, preppie leader Fred and his friends--haughty Daphne, brainy Velma, quasi-hippie Shaggy, and Shaggy's best pal, Scooby, an excitable Great Dane--chase down and are chased by alleged ghouls who generally turn out to be venal humans running various scams. Included here is Scooby-Doo 's premiere, \"What a Night for a Knight,\" in which the gang looks into the disappearance of a noted archaeologist and end up in a \"haunted\" museum. The fun \"Go Away Ghost Ship\" finds our heroes helping a shipping company daunted by the apparent ghost of pirate Red Beard, while the silly classic \"A Tiki Scare Is No Fair\" concerns a Hawaiian vacation for Mystery, Inc. disrupted by a witch doctor. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Excellent cartoons & quality viewing-------\nItem title: Speed (Widescreen Edition) [DVD] \n Item description: Single disc \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Nice movie-------\nItem title: Escape from New York \n Item description: Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef.
