In this mockkumentary spoof of \"Paul-Is-Dead\" theories, a mysterious voice on the tape reveals a secret Beatles history, chronicling McCartney's fatal accident, the cover up, and dozens of unknown clues, exposing \"Paul McCartney\" as an impostor! Highway 61 Entertainment has investigated this stunning new account of the conspiracy to hide McCartney's tragic death and produced this unauthorized documentary that includes newly unearthed evidence. The mysterious voice on the audio tapes narrates the entire film in what may prove to be the most important document in rock and roll history, leaving little doubt that PAUL MCCARTNEY REALLY IS DEAD! \n rating: 1.0 \n review: I think we ALL know that Paul isn't dead. Seriously, even if you are a conspiracy nut you know in your heart that it is all a hoax. But the worst crime of this film is how completely mind-numbing tedious this all is. I bought it thinking it would be an interesting hour and a half of entertainment. How wrong I was. The voice sounds nothing like Harrison, especially in his demeanor and attitude. So they found clues about death and dying and automobile accidents and Paul all through the Beatles songs (played forward and backwards) and album covers. Of course you could find clues about anything you wanted if you're looking for it though, couldn't you? What struck me was that the reality of the Beatles in their last days was that Paul was becoming the more creative as well as producing quality work and John was coasting a bit - in direct opposition to the theory here, which said that John was creating absolutely everything. As well as putting all the clues for us to find.<br /><br />What made this especially painful to watch is that they are taking the slightest bit of Beatles minutiae (the Paul is dead hoax) and focusing entirely on that, while ignoring one of the most interesting times in music history. By creating this fake scenario and giving it credence you take away from a story that needs nothing manufactured to be fascinating. The horrific narration of the supposed George Harrison is beyond ridiculous.<br /><br />This whole thing was a fiction designed at the time to sell magazines to 16 year olds. I guess the fact that it could sell books and dvds 4 decades later is a mystery in itself.-------\nItem title: I'm Not There (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) \n Item description: Since arriving in New York City's folk music scene in the 1960s, American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has become a major figure in popular music, influencing millions with his chart topping songs. His records have earned Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. \n rating: 2.0 \n review: Hollywood is in love with Bob Dylan, or more specifically the Idea and Icon of Bob Dylan. Just look how easy it was a few years ago to get a dozen major stars to participate in the bizarre mess of Masked and Anonymous just because Bob himself starred in it (and probably wrote it). Same thing here. Unfortunately my opinion of I'm Not There is that it is generally pointless and sadly lacking in contrast to the man's own art. The film was obviously written by a Dylan devotee. Hardcore Bob fans will see dozens of references to song lyrics, Bob on film and even obscure bootlegs. The problem with all of it is simply that it is not even close to comparing with the original. I can't stress enough - NOT EVEN CLOSE, to the point where most of the film is marginally painful to watch. I'm not a Dylan worshipper, just a fan for about 25 years but Bob Dylan is so much more interesting to watch and hear compared to the performances here. Every time a genuine Dylan song sung by Dylan was played it felt like a breath of fresh air just came in. The stilted acting makes one long for the actual footage of Bob himself onstage, in press conferences and in the documentaries out there like Dont Look Back and No Direction Home. The other embarrassing aspect of this film is that many scenes are played out too long so that everything can be explained, and the Dylan character can be wrapped up in a nice little gift box for us moviegoers who may be too stupid to understand the real Dylan (this is especially true with the Cate Blanchett scenes). Insulting to us and even more so to Dylan himself. I will say that I thought the Richard Gere segments pretty interesting, probably because he wasn't trying to directly imitate Dylan. If you're somewhat new to Bob Dylan and liked this film let me offer some advice - Buy the 4 hour Martin Scorsese produced documentary No Direction Home. Bob himself is here for the whole thing both in glorious flashbacks and as a present-day piercing-blue-eyed 60-something year old. Man, is he something to watch.-------\nItem title: Pacing the Cage \n Item description: An intimate look at Bruce Cockburn, his life and his music. Pacing the Cage is a documentary that features Canadian singer/songwriter/activist, Bruce Cockburn reflecting on his life and his career. The documentary features appearances by songwriters Jackson Browne, Sylvia Tyson, Bono, Sarah Harmer, Colin Linden, best selling authors Michael Ondaatje, William Young, Lt. Gen Romeo Dallaire and Bernie Finkelstein. Pacing the Cage follows Bruce as he performs in sold out shows, records his live Slice O Life CD, and participates in a series of benefit concerts. Documentary cameras also follow Bruce to his home for a candid conversation about his views on everything from religion to parenthood. The documentary will shed new light on Bruce s spirituality, and his thoughts on activism, politics, writing, and his amazing 40 plus years in the music industry. The DVD features never before seen live performances of songs from his 40 year plus catalogue of music. The final scenes and interviews of the documentary are present day. We peek into rehearsals for the recent Luminato tribute for Bruce, and interview Bruce at his home. During this final interview, Bruce reflects about his life and career, and where he sees himself going in the future.Bruce Cockburn, Pacing the Cage gives viewers never before seen insights into Bruce s life on the road, as a performer, master guitar player, activist and song-writer. \n rating: 3.0 \n review: This is an enjoyable 1 hour documentary that I found fairly interesting to watch the first time after it aired on television. When I just watched it again in the dvd release I realized that it is seriously lacking as any kind of document of Bruce Cockburn's life and career. As a document of this one solo tour in 2008 it gets the job done I suppose.<br /><br />Bruce's amazing musicianship and songwriting skills do of course come through in the songs he plays - some snippets and some full length songs. Although I did find the concert footage a bit sterile. I could tell that an audience was present but they are not shown and there is no interaction by Bruce with them. At any of the dozen Bruce shows I've been to(and the many live recordings I've heard) there is a palpable connection between audience and performer. A real love for Bruce that is manifest by the audience laughing at any mildly witty thing he says and even people unable to restrain themselves from shouting out song requests or asking questions. None of this comes through at all in these performances. I'm not saying they aren't quality performances but Bruce could almost be playing to an empty room.<br /><br />There are a lot of people in this film saying how wonderful Bruce is in regard to his songwriting skills, his guitar playing, his spirituality and his activism. None of this is new to anyone who has been a fan for a while, so there are few revelations here.  My favorite part part of the documentary is a very revealing couple minutes where Bruce opens up and shares how disappointed he was with his performance that particular night. Bernie, his long-time manager, reinforces how often this is the case - Bruce not satisfied with himself. This was amazing and interesting to me. My impression of Bruce is that he is never really OFF in concert and it really surprised me this revelation of his personality. I wish they had delved into this deeper, but we were soon back into more familiar adulatory waters.<br /><br />This is certainly a worthwhile purchase for any Bruce fan. I would also recommend the 2001 documentary My Beat, also short but it covers his early years a little bit.<br /><br />I will say something here though. Bruce is at the top of my list of favorite artists. I've been a fan for 3 decades and have listened to more Bruce music than any other artist. I love that Bruce has been so prolific, that the quality of his work has remained consistently amazing throughout his career, and the fact that he tours in my neck of the woods regularly. What I don't like is the flip side of the coin. Bruce is always looking forward, never backward. So this is the sort of thing we get (if we get anything at all) when it comes to a dvd release or anything archival (remasters notwithstanding). As far as concert video releases there is a VHS release from '81, and a couple semi-official things in the 80's. No dvds to speak of. No archival live cds, no box sets. Bruce's early formative years when he was very popular in Canada are almost completely undocumented in live video, even among collectors.<br /><br />How about a genuine multi-disc documentary covering all eras of Bruce's career with complete songs from the 70's through today?<br />Some archival live shows from the early years? A box set with unreleased tracks and rarities? A coffee table book with Bruce pictures and lyrics from his archives? We have seen many lesser artists get these things. Bruce is just as deserving.-------\nItem title: Marianne And Leonard: Words Of Love \n Item description: Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love is renowned filmmaker Nick Broomfield's most personal and romantic film of his storied career. The documentary starts on the Greek island of Hydra in 1960, where Leonard Cohen, then a struggling and unknown fiction writer, and Marianne Ihlen, a single mother with a young son, became part of community of expat artists, writers and musicians. Never-before-seen footage shot by Broomfield and legendary documentarian D.A. Pennebaker make for a unique portrait of an idyllic 1960's bohemia. It was a time that left a lasting imprint on both Marianne and Leonard, whose friendship would last another fifty years before their deaths in 2016. \n rating: 2.0 \n review: Bono has a great line - \"Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief; All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief\". That's Leonard Cohen in this movie. He loved Marianne and her son but there were just so many people he had to meet without any clothes. The tortured artist. Battling depression and drugs and alcohol. Do you think if he was just a little less of a selfish he wouldn't be so depressed? Or maybe it's just a coincidence. What about all the other artist types on the idyllic island of Hydra? Their drugs and alcohol abuse and open marriages? Shocking isn't it that so many of their kids later had drug issues and were suicidal and needed therapy. But back to Leonard - he did create a bunch of excellent 4 minute songs so it was probably all worth it. And he couldn't help himself. We might do the same thing if we were given those kind of temptations. I'm being serious when I say that. Like his manager and close friend stealing Leonard's life savings. She couldn't help herself either. It was right there and easy to take, just like Leonard plucking all the nubile fruit he wanted, back in those golden 60's and 70's. Do you think he ever compared those two things? It's not the same you say. Right. One is illegal and the other is just soul killing to many people. Especially Marianne. But I have to give Leonard some credit for having some self awareness later in life. You don't spend 6  years or more in a monastery unless you have a recognition of your spiritual bankruptcy. We all need that.<br /><br />This is a good movie that should make you think about life and choices and big things like that. Someone said the unexamined life is not worth living. But we'll give Leonard the last word where he said - \"The ponies run, the girls are young. The odds are there to beat. You win a while and then it's done, Your little winning streak\u2026\"-------\nItem title: My Beat: The Life and Times of Bruce Cockburn \n Item description: This one hour rockumentary takes us inside the life of Bruce Cockburn, the man and the musician, and includes live performances of Bruces hit songs: Lovers in a Dangerous Time, Wondering Where the Lions Are, If I Had a Rocket Launcher and They Call it Democracy. Bruce Cockburn is a rock musician, singer/songwriter, political activist and Canadian icon. From his beginnings in the late 60s with the rock group, The Children, through his solo career and musical collaborations over three decades, Bruce Cockburn has followed his own path creating music that has defied traditional labels. His life informs his music. He has consistently expressed and maintained political views that have deterred a mainstream audience. But his willingness to speak out on issues that many performers wont go near has earned him a strong following. Of the all inclusive nature of his work, Bruce says...if the purpose of art is to reflect life and the human experience, that includes politics, as inevitably as it includes sex and spirituality, money and all the other things that interest people. I like to get everything in there. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is a documentary produced for Canadian TV in 2001. It covers Bruce Cockburn's entire career from the late 60's to the present. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. There is footage of Bruce in concert (very short segments) throughout the years as well as his current commentary as we follow his career. My only complaint is that it runs about 50 minutes only. Bruce has been prolifically making music for 37 years and has released just about nothing as far as concert video (2 out-of-print VHS concerts and no official DVD's to be specific). Because of his relative obscurity in the 70's even hardcore collectors don't have anything before 1979. Bruce is amazing live, so this is puzzling to many of us. A multi-DVD retrospective of live Bruce throughout the years would be welcomed by fans. This documentary is a very nice appetizer.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I'd love to explore a new television series with intriguing plot twists and captivating characters, so I'm open to recommendations for a show that will keep me engaged and entertained.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

The mysterious voice on the audio tapes narrates the entire film in what may prove to be the most important document in rock and roll history, leaving little doubt that PAUL MCCARTNEY REALLY IS DEAD!  rating: 1.0  review: I think we ALL know that Paul isn't dead. Seriously, even if you are a conspiracy nut you know in your heart that it is all a hoax. But the worst crime of this film is how completely mind-numbing tedious this all is. I bought it thinking it would be an interesting hour and a half of entertainment. How wrong I was. The voice sounds nothing like Harrison, especially in his demeanor and attitude. So they found clues about death and dying and automobile accidents and Paul all through the Beatles songs (played forward and backwards) and album covers. Of course you could find clues about anything you wanted if you're looking for it though, couldn't you? What struck me was that the reality of the Beatles in their last days was that Paul was becoming the more creative as well as producing quality work and John was coasting a bit - in direct opposition to the theory here, which said that John was creating absolutely everything. As well as putting all the clues for us to find.<br /><br />What made this especially painful to watch is that they are taking the slightest bit of Beatles minutiae (the Paul is dead hoax) and focusing entirely on that, while ignoring one of the most interesting times in music history. By creating this fake scenario and giving it credence you take away from a story that needs nothing manufactured to be fascinating. The horrific narration of the supposed George Harrison is beyond ridiculous.<br /><br />This whole thing was a fiction designed at the time to sell magazines to 16 year olds. I guess the fact that it could sell books and dvds 4 decades later is a mystery in itself.-------Item title: I'm Not There (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)  Item description: Since arriving in New York City's folk music scene in the 1960s, American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has become a major figure in popular music, influencing millions with his chart topping songs. His records have earned Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame.  rating: 2.0  review: Hollywood is in love with Bob Dylan, or more specifically the Idea and Icon of Bob Dylan. Just look how easy it was a few years ago to get a dozen major stars to participate in the bizarre mess of Masked and Anonymous just because Bob himself starred in it (and probably wrote it). Same thing here. Unfortunately my opinion of I'm Not There is that it is generally pointless and sadly lacking in contrast to the man's own art. The film was obviously written by a Dylan devotee. Hardcore Bob fans will see dozens of references to song lyrics, Bob on film and even obscure bootlegs. The problem with all of it is simply that it is not even close to comparing with the original. I can't stress enough - NOT EVEN CLOSE, to the point where most of the film is marginally painful to watch. I'm not a Dylan worshipper, just a fan for about 25 years but Bob Dylan is so much more interesting to watch and hear compared to the performances here. Every time a genuine Dylan song sung by Dylan was played it felt like a breath of fresh air just came in. The stilted acting makes one long for the actual footage of Bob himself onstage, in press conferences and in the documentaries out there like Dont Look Back and No Direction Home. The other embarrassing aspect of this film is that many scenes are played out too long so that everything can be explained, and the Dylan character can be wrapped up in a nice little gift box for us moviegoers who may be too stupid to understand the real Dylan (this is especially true with the Cate Blanchett scenes). Insulting to us and even more so to Dylan himself. I will say that I thought the Richard Gere segments pretty interesting, probably because he wasn't trying to directly imitate Dylan. If you're somewhat new to Bob Dylan and liked this film let me offer some advice - Buy the 4 hour Martin Scorsese produced documentary No Direction Home. Bob himself is here for the whole thing both in glorious flashbacks and as a present-day piercing-blue-eyed 60-something year old. Man, is he something to watch.-------Item title: Pacing the Cage  Item description: An intimate look at Bruce Cockburn, his life and his music. Pacing the Cage is a documentary that features Canadian singer/songwriter/activist, Bruce Cockburn reflecting on his life and his career. The documentary features appearances by songwriters Jackson Browne, Sylvia Tyson, Bono, Sarah Harmer, Colin Linden, best selling authors Michael Ondaatje, William Young, Lt. Gen Romeo Dallaire and Bernie Finkelstein. Pacing the Cage follows Bruce as he performs in sold out shows, records his live Slice O Life CD, and participates in a series of benefit concerts. Documentary cameras also follow Bruce to his home for a candid conversation about his views on everything from religion to parenthood. The documentary will shed new light on Bruce s spirituality, and his thoughts on activism, politics, writing, and his amazing 40 plus years in the music industry. The DVD features never before seen live performances of songs from his 40 year plus catalogue of music. The final scenes and interviews of the documentary are present day. We peek into rehearsals for the recent Luminato tribute for Bruce, and interview Bruce at his home. During this final interview, Bruce reflects about his life and career, and where he sees himself going in the future.Bruce Cockburn, Pacing the Cage gives viewers never before seen insights into Bruce s life on the road, as a performer, master guitar player, activist and song-writer.  rating: 3.0  review: This is an enjoyable 1 hour documentary that I found fairly interesting to watch the first time after it aired on television. When I just watched it again in the dvd release I realized that it is seriously lacking as any kind of document of Bruce Cockburn's life and career. As a document of this one solo tour in 2008 it gets the job done I suppose.<br /><br />Bruce's amazing musicianship and songwriting skills do of course come through in the songs he plays - some snippets and some full length songs. Although I did find the concert footage a bit sterile. I could tell that an audience was present but they are not shown and there is no interaction by Bruce with them. At any of the dozen Bruce shows I've been to(and the many live recordings I've heard) there is a palpable connection between audience and performer. A real love for Bruce that is manifest by the audience laughing at any mildly witty thing he says and even people unable to restrain themselves from shouting out song requests or asking questions. None of this comes through at all in these performances. I'm not saying they aren't quality performances but Bruce could almost be playing to an empty room.<br /><br />There are a lot of people in this film saying how wonderful Bruce is in regard to his songwriting skills, his guitar playing, his spirituality and his activism. None of this is new to anyone who has been a fan for a while, so there are few revelations here.  My favorite part part of the documentary is a very revealing couple minutes where Bruce opens up and shares how disappointed he was with his performance that particular night. Bernie, his long-time manager, reinforces how often this is the case - Bruce not satisfied with himself. This was amazing and interesting to me. My impression of Bruce is that he is never really OFF in concert and it really surprised me this revelation of his personality. I wish they had delved into this deeper, but we were soon back into more familiar adulatory waters.<br /><br />This is certainly a worthwhile purchase for any Bruce fan. I would also recommend the 2001 documentary My Beat, also short but it covers his early years a little bit.<br /><br />I will say something here though. Bruce is at the top of my list of favorite artists. I've been a fan for 3 decades and have listened to more Bruce music than any other artist. I love that Bruce has been so prolific, that the quality of his work has remained consistently amazing throughout his career, and the fact that he tours in my neck of the woods regularly. What I don't like is the flip side of the coin. Bruce is always looking forward, never backward. So this is the sort of thing we get (if we get anything at all) when it comes to a dvd release or anything archival (remasters notwithstanding). As far as concert video releases there is a VHS release from '81, and a couple semi-official things in the 80's. No dvds to speak of. No archival live cds, no box sets. Bruce's early formative years when he was very popular in Canada are almost completely undocumented in live video, even among collectors.<br /><br />How about a genuine multi-disc documentary covering all eras of Bruce's career with complete songs from the 70's through today?<br />Some archival live shows from the early years? A box set with unreleased tracks and rarities? A coffee table book with Bruce pictures and lyrics from his archives? We have seen many lesser artists get these things. Bruce is just as deserving.-------Item title: Marianne And Leonard: Words Of Love  Item description: Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love is renowned filmmaker Nick Broomfield's most personal and romantic film of his storied career. The documentary starts on the Greek island of Hydra in 1960, where Leonard Cohen, then a struggling and unknown fiction writer, and Marianne Ihlen, a single mother with a young son, became part of community of expat artists, writers and musicians. Never-before-seen footage shot by Broomfield and legendary documentarian D.A. Pennebaker make for a unique portrait of an idyllic 1960's bohemia. It was a time that left a lasting imprint on both Marianne and Leonard, whose friendship would last another fifty years before their deaths in 2016.  rating: 2.0  review: Bono has a great line - \"Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief; All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief\". That's Leonard Cohen in this movie. He loved Marianne and her son but there were just so many people he had to meet without any clothes. The tortured artist. Battling depression and drugs and alcohol. Do you think if he was just a little less of a selfish he wouldn't be so depressed? Or maybe it's just a coincidence. What about all the other artist types on the idyllic island of Hydra? Their drugs and alcohol abuse and open marriages? Shocking isn't it that so many of their kids later had drug issues and were suicidal and needed therapy. But back to Leonard - he did create a bunch of excellent 4 minute songs so it was probably all worth it. And he couldn't help himself. We might do the same thing if we were given those kind of temptations. I'm being serious when I say that. Like his manager and close friend stealing Leonard's life savings. She couldn't help herself either. It was right there and easy to take, just like Leonard plucking all the nubile fruit he wanted, back in those golden 60's and 70's. Do you think he ever compared those two things? It's not the same you say. Right. One is illegal and the other is just soul killing to many people. Especially Marianne. But I have to give Leonard some credit for having some self awareness later in life. You don't spend 6  years or more in a monastery unless you have a recognition of your spiritual bankruptcy. We all need that.<br /><br />This is a good movie that should make you think about life and choices and big things like that. Someone said the unexamined life is not worth living. But we'll give Leonard the last word where he said - \"The ponies run, the girls are young. The odds are there to beat. You win a while and then it's done, Your little winning streak\u2026\"-------Item title: My Beat: The Life and Times of Bruce Cockburn  Item description: This one hour rockumentary takes us inside the life of Bruce Cockburn, the man and the musician, and includes live performances of Bruces hit songs: Lovers in a Dangerous Time, Wondering Where the Lions Are, If I Had a Rocket Launcher and They Call it Democracy. Bruce Cockburn is a rock musician, singer/songwriter, political activist and Canadian icon. From his beginnings in the late 60s with the rock group, The Children, through his solo career and musical collaborations over three decades, Bruce Cockburn has followed his own path creating music that has defied traditional labels. His life informs his music. He has consistently expressed and maintained political views that have deterred a mainstream audience. But his willingness to speak out on issues that many performers wont go near has earned him a strong following. Of the all inclusive nature of his work, Bruce says...if the purpose of art is to reflect life and the human experience, that includes politics, as inevitably as it includes sex and spirituality, money and all the other things that interest people. I like to get everything in there.  rating: 5.0  review: This is a documentary produced for Canadian TV in 2001. It covers Bruce Cockburn's entire career from the late 60's to the present. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. There is footage of Bruce in concert (very short segments) throughout the years as well as his current commentary as we follow his career. My only complaint is that it runs about 50 minutes only. Bruce has been prolifically making music for 37 years and has released just about nothing as far as concert video (2 out-of-print VHS concerts and no official DVD's to be specific). Because of his relative obscurity in the 70's even hardcore collectors don't have anything before 1979. Bruce is amazing live, so this is puzzling to many of us. A multi-DVD retrospective of live Bruce throughout the years would be welcomed by fans. This documentary is a very nice appetizer.-------```And here is the user's intention: I'd love to explore a new television series with intriguing plot twists and captivating characters, so I'm open to recommendations for a show that will keep me engaged and entertained.Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Kenneth MacMillan's L'histoire de Manon \n Description: Since it was first published in 1731, L'Histoire du Chevalier Dex Grieux et de Manon Lescaut has been the object of numerous adaptations for both stage and screen. In the 19th century, Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber, Jules Massenet and Giacomo Puccini used Abbe Prevost's novel as the theme for their respective operas. After 1912, cinema transposed the story of Manon and the Knight into varying degrees of melodramatic intensity. In 1974 British choreographer Kenneth MacMillan in turn decided to focus on the two protagonists for an ambitious ballet that could translate the feelings and emotions of two souls abused by the accidents of life and their own personal weaknesses. In short, how a young girl on her way to a convent manages to elope with the young student with whom she has just fallen in love, only to leave him to escape destitution and finally allow herself to be persuaded by her brother Lescaut to yield to the advances of wealthy \"protectors.\" Rather than reuse the score of Massenet's opera, MacMillan entrusted Leighton Lucas with the task of arranging a series of extracts taken from a selection of the French composer's operatic, symphonic and vocal scores. The end result was a huge success from it's debut performance in London in 1974 onwards. Sixteen years later, L'Histoire de Manon entered the Paris Opera Ballet's repertoire.",

Amazon.com Part- Lost , part- The Day After , television's first Code Orange serial drama very effectively taps into palpable post-9/11 dread. The residents of Jericho are literally in the dark when they are cut off from civilization in the wake of a nuclear blast. Has the United States been attacked? How many cities were destroyed? Was it terrorists, or something way more sinister? It is up to Johnston Green (an Emmy-worthy Gerald McRaney), the town's mayor (and series bedrock), to calm the community, keep its citizens from turning on each other, and protect them from predatory outsiders. Johnston's son, Jake (Skeet Ulrich), a \"screw-up,\" returns home just prior to the blast following a mysterious five-year absence. Jake is at odds with his estranged father, who is running for reelection, and his brother, Eric (Kenneth Mitchell), his deputy. Nor is he welcomed back by his former girlfriend, Emily (Ashley Scott), now engaged to a man who is missing following the blast. With the fate of America in the balance, one would think that \"small town problems\" wouldn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy new world, but it is Jericho 's human dramas that resonate most deeply. On the most cherished TV shows, characters come to feel like family. Jericho 's characters come to feel like neighbors. Dale (Erik Knudson), the orphaned teenage outcast, forms an unexpected friendship with the town's spoiled mean girl, Skylar (Candace Bailey). Robert Hawkins (Lennie James), just arrived in town, introduces himself as a former cop from St. Louis, but his secret basement command center suggests otherwise. Gray Anderson (Michael Gaston), a mayoral candidate, politicizes the disaster to undermine Johnston. Stanley (Brad Beyer), a farmer, falls in love with his condescending IRS auditor from Washington, D.C. (Alicia Coppola). And Eric plans to leave his wife, Alice (Darby Stanchfield) for bartender Mary (Clare Carey). But at the heart of Jericho 's first season is Jake's hard-earned redemption in his family's (and Emily's) eyes (suddenly, he's a regular MacGyver, able to perform a tracheotomy with a juice box straw!). Star Trek has its Trekkies/-ers and Laurel and Hardy its fraternal organization, the Sons of the Desert . Jericho has its \"Nuts,\" who, in heroic It Takes a Village spirit, mounted a monumental campaign to rescue the series after it had been cancelled. Fans posted a barrage of videos on You Tube and deluged the studio with peanuts (the significance is explained in the season finale). \"What is it about this town that has you so addicted to it?\" someone asks Emily at one point.

        "ground_truth": "Title: She's the One / Simply Irresistible \n Description: Product description No Description Available. Genre: Feature Film-Comedy Rating: UN Release Date: 5-DEC-2006 Media Type: DVD Amazon.com She's the One : Following the success of his spunky, 1995 directorial debut, The Brothers McMullen , Edward Burns suffers a little sophomore slump with this comedy about a pair of rivalrous brothers who get into bizarre relationships with women in a fierce but immature pursuit of happiness. When they find they both have a complicated interest in the same woman (Cameron Diaz), things come to a head. The film is a little overwritten, undershot, bulky, slow, and static, but it is also funny and inventive--further proof that Burns knows his New York City beat as well as Woody Allen does. With Jennifer Aniston, Maxine Bahns, and John Mahoney. -- Tom Keogh Simply Irresistible : Call it Buffy the Culinary Slayer. Sarah Michelle Gellar, known for running around staking vampires and fighting demons, turns cute and cuddly as an aspiring chef in this magical-realist comedy that borrows a page--heck, whole chapters--from Like Water for Chocolate . Out at the market one day, Gellar stumbles on both a magical crab and the babelicious Sean Patrick Flanery who, wouldn't you know it, is opening up a posh restaurant at Bendel's department store (actually, the two have been brought together by fairy godfather Christopher Durang). Odd and implausible circumstances give these two cuties more opportunities to moon at each other, and suddenly Gellar's cooking takes off--turns out all her nicey-nice feelings towards Flanery are going into her cooking, with the help of that quiet but powerful little crab. Gellar's almost-closed restaurant starts to thrive, and her desserts begin making everyone horny. A cute premise that never really takes off, Simply Irresistible glides along on Gellar's charisma alone, working to give some depth to her one-dimensional character. Flanery, though, while appealing at times, plays up his character's commitment-phobia to irritating degrees. Chock full of fairy-tale elements that never really come together (is that crab really necessary?), Irresistible does boast charming performances by Patricia Clarkson and Dylan Baker as Flanery's secretary and boss, respectively. However, it's a little odd to see these two, who scored raves for two serious and harrowing art-house flicks (Clarkson in High Art , Baker in Happiness ) doing the light-and-fluffy romantic comedy thing. They're two of the very few ingredients that occasionally make this souffl\u00e9 of a movie rise; at the end, however, it's flat as a pancake. -- Mark Englehart",

Moving to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a famous songwriter, Violet Sanford (Perabo) finds herself desperate and broke. Through a twist of fate, the shy, innocent Violet lands a job as one of the barmaids at the hottest nightclub in town -- the down and dirty, wild and fun Coyote Ugly. Pouring drinks and overflowing with attitude, the \"Coyotes\" spend more time on top of the bar than behind it, tantalizing the standing-room-only crowd with their outrageous antics! It's one wild adventure for a small-town girl chasing her dream in the big city. Amazon.com As a producer, Jerry Bruckheimer makes movies for guys, mostly action films like Top Gun and Gone in 60 Seconds . The ones he makes that feature women, such as Flashdance and now Coyote Ugly , broaden their appeal with a fondness for \"strong women.\" For Bruckheimer, that means self-determined, attractive women who don't need men to get what they want. Is there anything sexier than that? In Coyote Ugly , the charming young waif Piper Perabo stars as Violet, a New Jersey waitress who moves to New York to make it big as a songwriter. She has absolutely no idea how the music business works, relying instead on her faith in her own abilities. In order to make ends meet, she gets a job in a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders are scantily clad women who dance on the bar and order around their mostly male clientele. Really, they are strippers who don't have to take off their clothes. In fact, the owner (Maria Bello) orders them to enact the first rule of strip clubs: \"Appear available but never be available.\" Bruckheimer is smart enough to focus on the naive girl instead of the seamier side of the story, following her as she realizes her dream and picks up a disposable but nice man along the way. Further \"empowering\" the female figures in the film, Zoe (Tyra Banks), the bartender whom Violet is replacing, leaves in order to go to law school. See? They're as smart as they are sexy! Then there's John Goodman, who turns in an absolutely charming performance as Violet's concerned father. This is a sweet and inoffensive film as long as you don't think too much about it. --Andy Spletzer \n rating: 5.0 \n review: good movie, always loved it, and had to get it for my DVD collection-------\nItem title: Murphy's Romance [DVD] \n Item description: The last thing Emma Moriarty expected to find in Eunice, Arizona, was love.

I would recommend it highly!!!-------Item title: Coyote Ugly  Item description: Product Description From hit-making producer Jerry Bruckheimer (GONE IN 60 SECONDS, ARMEGEDDON) comes COYOTE UGLY, the intoxicating sexy comedy starring an unbeatable cast of hot new stars inlcuding Piper Perabo (ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE) and Maria Bello (PAYBACK). Moving to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a famous songwriter, Violet Sanford (Perabo) finds herself desperate and broke. Through a twist of fate, the shy, innocent Violet lands a job as one of the barmaids at the hottest nightclub in town -- the down and dirty, wild and fun Coyote Ugly. Pouring drinks and overflowing with attitude, the \"Coyotes\" spend more time on top of the bar than behind it, tantalizing the standing-room-only crowd with their outrageous antics! It's one wild adventure for a small-town girl chasing her dream in the big city. Amazon.com As a producer, Jerry Bruckheimer makes movies for guys, mostly action films like Top Gun and Gone in 60 Seconds . The ones he makes that feature women, such as Flashdance and now Coyote Ugly , broaden their appeal with a fondness for \"strong women.\" For Bruckheimer, that means self-determined, attractive women who don't need men to get what they want. Is there anything sexier than that? In Coyote Ugly , the charming young waif Piper Perabo stars as Violet, a New Jersey waitress who moves to New York to make it big as a songwriter. She has absolutely no idea how the music business works, relying instead on her faith in her own abilities. In order to make ends meet, she gets a job in a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders are scantily clad women who dance on the bar and order around their mostly male clientele. Really, they are strippers who don't have to take off their clothes. In fact, the owner (Maria Bello) orders them to enact the first rule of strip clubs: \"Appear available but never be available.\" Bruckheimer is smart enough to focus on the naive girl instead of the seamier side of the story, following her as she realizes her dream and picks up a disposable but nice man along the way. Further \"empowering\" the female figures in the film, Zoe (Tyra Banks), the bartender whom Violet is replacing, leaves in order to go to law school. See? They're as smart as they are sexy! Then there's John Goodman, who turns in an absolutely charming performance as Violet's concerned father. This is a sweet and inoffensive film as long as you don't think too much about it. --Andy Spletzer  rating: 5.0  review: good movie, always loved it, and had to get it for my DVD collection-------Item title: Murphy's Romance [DVD]  Item description: The last thing Emma Moriarty expected to find in Eunice, Arizona, was love.

The sheriff becomes involved in the illicit operations, making sure his men and federal agents stay clear of the stills. When a deputy stumbles upon the still and is killed, this makes the sheriff an accomplice to the crime. Amazon.com Definitely not to be confused with 2005's much-honored Walk the Line , director John Frankenheimer's 1970 film I Walk the Line uses the music of Johnny Cash to tell a very different story. Gregory Peck is Henry Tawes, the sheriff of a depressed and depressing rural backwater whose life goes pretty much straight into the outhouse once he lays eyes on Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld), daughter of a local moonshiner. Bored with his job and his home life alike, Tawes may not suffer fools, but he's only too willing to become one once Alma, an irresistible and much younger Tennessee tart (Peck was in his mid-fifties at the time; Weld was nearly three decades behind him), starts pulling his strings at the behest of her pa (Ralph Meeker), who's using his daughter to help, uh, persuade the sheriff to overlook his criminal activities. It's obvious from the git-go that none of this will turn out well for our hero, and while Frankenheimer (who directed the original Manchurian Candidate ) and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (a future Oscar winner for Ordinary People and Julia ) do a decent job of keeping the tension mounting, the film never quite catches fire. Part of that is due to the measured, laconic performance delivered by Peck, who has a certain dignity that keeps him from really inhabiting his role; much more convincing is Charles Durning as his deputy, a donut-eating, law-bending Southern slug. On the other hand, it's always nice to hear Cash delivering the classic title song, even if his several other tunes featured in I Walk the Line fall somewhat short of that standard. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Both Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld are both a couple of my all time favorite actors.

Returning to Michigan, Reese finds that an ex-grad student (Warner) and a would-be musician (Ferrell) have moved in with her father, who cares more about his new friends than he does about his own health and well-being. Amazon.com Reese (Zooey Deschanel, All the Real Girls ) is a brusk barmaid/actress, toiling away in the East Village fringe circuit. Her father is reclusive J.D. Salinger-like author Don Holdin (Ed Harris, A History of Violence ). Reese hasn't seen him for years. One night after a performance, an editor from a major publishing house (Amy Madigan, Carniv\u00e0le ), offers $100,000 for the letters he and her late mother exchanged during their courtship. Reese turns her down flat. Eventually, she changes her mind and takes off for rural Michigan to retrieve them. She finds the disheveled, hard-drinking Don living with former student Shelly (Amelia Warner, Quills ) and ex-Christian rocker Corbit (a disarmingly straight-faced Will Ferrell). It's a bizarre, if functional arrangement: Shelly cooks the meals, while Corbit serves as security guard. All try to make nice, but the coke-snorting, insult-flinging Reese won't have any of it. She just wants to find the letters and go. This turns out to be trickier than expected, especially once she actually sits down to read them. Directed by and adapted from his two-act play, Adam Rapp's Winter Passing is the kind of well-intentioned independent where longstanding family issues are solved in just a few days (to the gentle strains of Cat Power and the Shins). Nonetheless, it offers the unique opportunity to see Deschanel and Ferrell, Elf 's charmingly mis-matched couple, cast against type. As expected, Harris provides solid support, while Warner's clear-eyed Shelly is the true heart of the story. --Kathleen C.

Killer Dwarf. Notoriously lacking restraint, sexy pinky violence star, Reiko Ike, returns in this gonzo sequel to Sex & Fury following the further exploits of Ocho, a thief and gambler running afoul of evil yakuza in Meiji Era Tokyo. Aided by a lone wolf adventurer (Ryohei Uchida), Ocho investigates a ruthless gang of cutthroats who are using indentured prostitutes as drug mules to smuggle heroin from China. Director Ishii throws everything but the kitchen sink into this mind-altering sexploitation action saga, all culminating in a bloody mobster massacre replete with sultry swordswomen. Full of intoxicating mayhem and uproarious kabuki-striptease antics, Female Yakuza Tale Inquisition & Torture is freak-out filmmaking at its finest! Panik House is proud to present Female Yakuza Tale uncut, uncensored and totally restored from the original vault elements. Available for the first time anywhere on DVD! Review Amazon.com If you want to know where Quentin Tarantino got some of his inspiration for Kill Bill, check out Female Yakuza Tale: Inquisition and Torture, a spicy slice of Japanese sexploitation from 1973. It's a brazenly unrestrained sequel to Norifumi Suzuki's similarly trashy Sex & Fury (another cult favorite among fans of Japanese pulp cinema), and director Teruo Ishii demonstrates his disdain for sequels by dishing up a lurid crime tale filled with rampant sex, female nudity, and blood-spurting ultraviolence. Set in Meiji-era Tokyo circa 1905, the outlandish story kicks into high gear when renegade thief and gambler Ocho (Reiko Ike, fully recovered from the bloodbath in Sex & Fury) is joined by a \"lone wolf\" drifter (Ryohei Uchida) in pursuit of a gang of murderous thugs with connections to the gruesome \"crotch gouge\" murders (involving deadly injuries that are best left to the imagination). By the time they close in on a disgusting kingpin who's been enslaving prostitutes to smuggle Chinese heroin in their nether regions, Ocho has recruited a small army of sexy, sword-wielding hookers who aren't feeling the least bit merciful. The result is an outrageous orgy of bullets, and bloodshed, carried out with abundant humor, chaotic choreography, and dazzling use of colorful low-budget settings. Befitting such a delirious dose of sexplo-trash, this high-quality, beautifully mastered DVD release caters to its intended audience with an authoritative audio commentary by Chris Desjardins (author of Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film), whose expert programming of this and other \"Pinky Violence\" films (at the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles) resulted in a renewed appreciation for mind-blowing Asian action films that are defiantly off the beaten path.

Join four-man army Sgt. Sam Troy (Christopher George), Sgt. Jack Moffitt (Gary Raymond), Pvt. Mark Hitchcock (Lawrence Casey) and Pvt. Tully Pettigrew (Justin Tarr) as they wage war against Nazis, traitors and wild-eyed fanatics in this action-packed first season collection, featuring all 32 explosive episodes, uncut, unedited and commercial-free! Amazon.com Veteran TV writer/director Tom Gries ( East Side/West Side , Helter Skelter ) created this action-packed drama about a four-man commando team (three Americans and one British) battling the German Army's Afrika Korps in World War II. Though primarily a vehicle for adventure fans, The Rat Patrol benefited from smart scripting (Larry Cohen and Richard Landau both penned stories for the series) that refused to paint the German antagonist, Capt. Dietrich (well played by Hans Gudegast, who's better known today as Eric Braeden), as a stock Nazi heel; in fact, Christopher George's Sgt. Sam Troy and Dietrich occasionally partnered up to combat a common foe, as in the series' fifth and tenth episodes (\"The Chain of Death Raid\" and \"The Moment of Truce Raid,\" both of which are included in this four-disc set), which pit them against Arab fighters. Other highlights from the 1966-67 debut season include \"The Kill or Be Killed Raid\" (Gary Raymond's Moffitt must impersonate a German soldier to find a map to a hidden water source), \"The Wildest Raid of All\" (the Rat Patrol's plan to capture an important Nazi general goes awry), and \"The Blind Man's Bluff Raid\" (the Germans impersonate an American unit to trick a sunblinded Troy into revealing the Rat Patrol's location), but all 32 episodes deliver plenty of action and excitement.

For years, George Needleman (Levy), the gentle CFO of a Wall Street investment bank, has been living with his head in the clouds. His frustrated second wife, Kate (Richards), has reached her limit taking care of his senile mother, Barbara (Roberts). His teenage daughter, Cindy (Danielle Campbell), is spoiled beyond hope and his seven-year-old son, Howie (Devan Leos), wishes his father were around more. But George is finally forced to wake up when he learns that his firm, Lockwise Industries, has been operating a mob-backed Ponzi scheme and that he's been set up as the fall guy.

That's the simple but hilarious premise behind Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection , a straight-up slapstick hit with a sweet message underlying the shtick. Tyler Perry plays Madea, of course, as well as several other parts. The always-hilarious Eugene Levy plays the hapless George Needleman, a schlub of a businessman who's been sucked into laundering money for a low-level mob family. When he realizes his predicament, he is sent to hide out with Madea. Of course complications ensue, and Madea's called upon to help George's family--so while he is hiding out, Madea also goes \"under cover\" as a Manhattan socialite, trying to follow some of the laundered money that should have gone to charity. Perry's ensemble cast keeps things moving at a hilarious pace, and fans of the Madea franchise will love Witness Protection . The supporting cast is splendid, including Tom Arnold, who has a memorable cameo; Denise Richards as George's wife; and Doris Roberts as George's befuddled mom. Madea can handle them all with aplomb--and the mob probably better watch its back too. This edition contains great special features, including a look at how Perry \"does\" Madea; the world of Madea; a look at the Needlemans; and a salute to Madea's comedy icons.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Yoga For Inflexible People \n Description: Product Description Yoga For Inflexible People is for anyone who considers themselves inflexible. The yoga postures developed 5,000 years ago were not created for people who are already flexible, but rather to help inflexible people become more flexible. A wide range of poses are taught and modified to help both beginning and intermediate students experience the benefits of yoga. The modifications includes suggestions for the use of props, which can be either actual yoga props or items you have around the home, such as a belt or books, to assist you when you feel you need additional assistance. Of course if you do not need props, you do not have to use any. Customized workouts allow you to progress at your own pace and the DVD contains dozens of routines which designed to carefully guide you along your journey into yoga. When Yoga For Inflexible People was released, the Yoga Journal declared it \"One of the most intelligent and useful presentations served up in a long time\" and praised it as a DVD \"...for all beginning students whether they are inflexible or flexible.\" Yoga For Inflexible People continued to be commended as the Yoga Journal rated the DVD as one the Top Yoga DVDs ever produced. (December 2006) Amazon.com Yoga isn't just for people who are already supple--it's a way to become more flexible. Yoga for Inflexible People presents modifications and props to make traditional poses accessible to people who could not otherwise perform them comfortably or correctly. You get more than 35 workouts and about four hours of instruction and practice in all. Choose a general workout, focus on an area of the body (shoulders, legs, hips, and back), or select a peaceful or energizing workout. Within each category, you have a choice of several different 15- to 75-minute series (some seated), much more variety than most videos offer. Some of the poses are beginning level; others are not. Leader Judi Rice demonstrates well, instructing by voice-over, though her expressionless face lacks warmth and personality. You'll need a yoga mat, blocks (or large books), a long strap or belt, a chair, and blankets. --Joan Price Review \"Best Buy...will revolutionize your home yoga practice... Finally, an at-home yoga series customized to suit your needs!\" -- Body & Soul Magazine A great stretch forward for yoga videos -- Alternative Medicine Highly Recommended -- Video Librarian One of the most intelligent and useful presentations served up in a long time. -- Yoga Journal Top of the list! I have replaced all of the yoga tapes I used to own. -- Balanced Living See more",

        "ground_truth": "Title: Alpha And Omega - Two Disc Combo Pack [DVD + Blu-ray + Digital Copy] \n Description: Product Description Come along on the ultimate road-trip adventure that will leave the whole family howling with laughter! When Kate, a take-charge \u201cAlpha\u201d wolf, and Humphrey, a laid-back \u201cOmega\u201d wolf, get snatched by park rangers and relocated halfway across the country, the two must set off on an incredible journey home! With the help of a goofy golfing goose and his quacky duck caddy, Kate and Humphrey won\u2019t let anything stop them \u2013 prickly porcupines, grumpy bears, even a speeding locomotive \u2013 from getting back to Jasper Park in time to help save their pack from rival wolves! And along the way, Kate and Humphrey learn that even though they are complete opposites, they make a pretty good team! It\u2019s a thousand miles of fun in this wildly entertaining journey the whole pack can enjoy together! Amazon.com Love is blind to the rules of tradition, opposites attract, and both clich\u00e9s apply quite nicely to the wolves in Alpha and Omega . In the wolf world, the pack values the omega wolves' skill of defusing tense situations with humor just as much as they value the keen leadership skills of the alpha wolves, but tradition dictates that alpha wolves don't mate with omega wolves. So, when the all-business alpha wolf Kate (Hayden Panettiere) and the fun-seeking omega wolf Humphrey (Justin Long) find themselves attracted to one another, the pair resign themselves to a life apart, and Kate agrees to a match with alpha male Garth (Chris Carmack) from a rival pack in order to peacefully merge the two packs into one. But when Humphrey and Kate are tranquilized in their home in Jasper National Forest, Canada, and relocated to Sawtooth Forest far away in Idaho, the two discover that not only can opposites work very well together, but that neither of them can continue to ignore their attraction for the other. The question is, will working together, combined with a little help from a golf-playing goose and his duck caddy, be enough to get the pair all the way back to Jasper National Park before the rival wolf packs tear one another apart at the next full moon? And what will become of their relationship if they do return in time? This animated 3-D film is amusing and entertaining, if not particularly outstanding. A lot of the humor is pretty corny and the plot has been done many times before (think Open Season 2 ), but the characters are likable, the action is pretty good, and who can resist chuckling at images like a retired, golf-playing French-Canadian goose or the distractive powers of a good cupcake?

Epic is a computer-animated adventure fantasy filled with gorgeous scenery, nice animated effects, plenty of action, and a somewhat familiar plot about the existence of a society of tiny people. Mary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried), or M.K. as she likes to be called, has recently come to live with her dad Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) in a ramshackle house in the middle of nowhere. Obsessed with proving the existence of a society of tiny guardians of the forest called Leafmen, who are responsible for maintaining balance by keeping the Boggans from spreading blight throughout the forest, M.K.'s dad has little time for a daughter or the realities of everyday life. A chance event lands M.K. right in the middle of the Leafmen's society, where she quickly develops a whole new appreciation for her father's eccentricities. She finds herself charged by the Leafmen's queen (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles) with a difficult task that will mean the difference between preservation and destruction for the forest. M.K. joins forces with an assortment of unlikely heroes, including slug and snail duo Mub and Grub (Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd), overzealous Leafmen commander General Ronin (Colin Farrell), and Nod (Josh Hutcherson), a soldier with a bad habit of questioning authority. Their perilous journey introduces M.K. to a strange new breed of enemy and a whole new way of thinking. Loosely based on William Joyce's book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs, the film shares its premise--a society of tiny people tries to thrive without drawing the attention of the larger humans--with films like the Tinker Bell movies and The Secret World of Arrietty. What's unique about Epic is that it's just as much action film as fantasy.

Amazon.com Based on William Joyce's the Guardians of Childhood book series, Rise of the Guardians is a gorgeously animated film about Boogeyman Pitch Black's attempts to spread darkness and fear throughout the world and the guardians' attempts to foil him. Charged with the duty of watching over the children of the world, guardians Sandman, North, Tooth, and E. Aster Bunnymund are loved by children everywhere. When the Man in the Moon appoints Jack Frost to be the newest guardian, the other guardians doubt that Jack can be of much help against Pitch, especially considering that the children don't even believe in Jack Frost's existence. But when Pitch prevents Tooth from collecting the children's teeth, keeps E. Aster Bunnymund from hiding eggs on Easter, and turns the children's happy dreams into nightmares, the guardians realize that they're going to need all the help they can get. The children stop believing in the guardians one by one, and the question that remains is what can one fun-loving, somewhat immature boy with the power to freeze everything he touches possibly do to counteract the fear and darkness enveloping the world? The animation effects are excellent in this film--especially the images of frost and ice spreading across ponds and windowpanes. The characters are interestingly quirky, the action is constant and well paced, and the considerable voice talent includes Alec Baldwin, Chris Pine, Jude Law, Isla Fisher, and Hugh Jackman. A familiarity with the books aids deeper understanding of characters like North and Sandman, but viewers unfamiliar with the books will have no problem enjoying this film.

Sumptuous period epic. Glorious celebration of the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This marvelous winner of eight Academy Awards(R) portrays the rivalry between the genius Mozart (Tom Hulce) and the jealous court composer (Best Actor Oscar(R) Winner F.Murray Abraham) who may have ruined Mozart's career and shortened his life. ]]> Amazon.com A note-perfect cinematic event whose immortality was assured from its opening night, Amadeus is an unlikely candidate for the director's-cut treatment. Like one of Mozart's operas, the multiple Oscar-winning theatrical version seemed perfectly formed from the outset--ideal casting, costumes, sets, cinematography, lighting, screenplay, music, music, music--so the reinstatement of an extra 20 minutes simply risks adding \"too many notes.\" Yet though this extended cut can hardly be said to improve a picture that needed no improvement, it does at least flesh out a couple of small subplots and shed new light on certain key scenes. Here we learn why Constanze Mozart bears such ill will towards Salieri when she discovers him at her husband's deathbed, and we see deeper into the reasons why Mozart has no students. The structure of the picture is otherwise unaltered. The director's cut of Amadeus finally accords this masterful work the DVD treatment it deserves. The handsome anamorphic widescreen picture is accompanied by a choice of Dolby 5.1 or Dolby stereo sound options, and it's all contained on one side of the disc. Director Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer provide a chatty though sporadic commentary, but they're obviously still too mesmerized by the movie to do much more than offer the odd anecdote. The second disc contains an excellent new hour-long \"making of\" documentary, with contributions from Forman, Shaffer, Sir Neville Marriner, and all the main actors, taking in the scriptwriting, choice of music, casting, and problems involved in filming in Communist Czechoslovakia with half the crew and extras working for the Secret Police. --Mark Walker \n rating: 5.0 \n review: One of the best movies ever made, a classic.-------\nItem title: Monsters, Inc.

Only THE LION KING, released in the \"pre-DVD\" era, sold more units when it debuted on VHS in 1995.|Typically, voice actors record their parts individually and never meet their costars -- but John Goodman and Billy Crystal broke animation protocol for MONSTERS, INC., and recorded their parts at the same time. Says Crystal: \"I did the first session alone ... and I said, 'You know, this is terrible.'\" Director Pete Docter \"kept wanting all different line readings of the same line,\" Crystal says. '\"Why am I doing all of these?' I asked. He said, 'Well, in case I change the scene around, and I'll get John to do it.' I said, 'Isn't that just silly? When we can be together and do it together and play the scenes?'

Obsessed with proving the existence of a society of tiny guardians of the forest called Leafmen, who are responsible for maintaining balance by keeping the Boggans from spreading blight throughout the forest, M.K.'s dad has little time for a daughter or the realities of everyday life. A chance event lands M.K. right in the middle of the Leafmen's society, where she quickly develops a whole new appreciation for her father's eccentricities. She finds herself charged by the Leafmen's queen (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles) with a difficult task that will mean the difference between preservation and destruction for the forest. M.K. joins forces with an assortment of unlikely heroes, including slug and snail duo Mub and Grub (Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd), overzealous Leafmen commander General Ronin (Colin Farrell), and Nod (Josh Hutcherson), a soldier with a bad habit of questioning authority. Their perilous journey introduces M.K. to a strange new breed of enemy and a whole new way of thinking. Loosely based on William Joyce's book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs, the film shares its premise--a society of tiny people tries to thrive without drawing the attention of the larger humans--with films like the Tinker Bell movies and The Secret World of Arrietty. What's unique about Epic is that it's just as much action film as fantasy.

Young owl Soren marvels at his father's epic stories of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, mythic winged warriors who fought a great battle to save all owl kind from the evil Pure Ones. When he and brother Kludd fall from their treetop home and into the talons of the Pure Ones, it's up to Soren to make a daring escape with the help of other brave owls. Together they seek the Great Tree, home of the Guardians--the only hope of defeating the Pure Ones and saving the owl kingdoms. The stellar voice cast includes Abbie Cornish, Miriam Margolyes, Helen Mirren, Sam Neill, Geoffrey Rush, Jim Sturgess and Hugo Weaving. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This movie scared my four year old.  Some of the characters showed a lot of aggressive behavior and were very angry.  I love the movie but would definitely wait until the kids are older than 5  years old.-------\nItem title: Rise of the Guardians \n Item description: Product Description 2013 Golden Globe\u00ae Nominee, Best Animated Feature Film 10 Annie Award Nominations, including Best Animated Feature A magical and heartwarming adventure for the whole family! Amazon.com Based on William Joyce's the Guardians of Childhood book series, Rise of the Guardians is a gorgeously animated film about Boogeyman Pitch Black's attempts to spread darkness and fear throughout the world and the guardians' attempts to foil him. Charged with the duty of watching over the children of the world, guardians Sandman, North, Tooth, and E. Aster Bunnymund are loved by children everywhere. When the Man in the Moon appoints Jack Frost to be the newest guardian, the other guardians doubt that Jack can be of much help against Pitch, especially considering that the children don't even believe in Jack Frost's existence. But when Pitch prevents Tooth from collecting the children's teeth, keeps E. Aster Bunnymund from hiding eggs on Easter, and turns the children's happy dreams into nightmares, the guardians realize that they're going to need all the help they can get. The children stop believing in the guardians one by one, and the question that remains is what can one fun-loving, somewhat immature boy with the power to freeze everything he touches possibly do to counteract the fear and darkness enveloping the world? The animation effects are excellent in this film--especially the images of frost and ice spreading across ponds and windowpanes. The characters are interestingly quirky, the action is constant and well paced, and the considerable voice talent includes Alec Baldwin, Chris Pine, Jude Law, Isla Fisher, and Hugh Jackman. A familiarity with the books aids deeper understanding of characters like North and Sandman, but viewers unfamiliar with the books will have no problem enjoying this film. (Ages 7 and older) --Tami Horiuchi \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This movie is beautiful but may be too complex for children under five years of age.  I loved it but would wait for the kids to be 5 or older.-------\nItem title: The Polar Express [Blu-ray] \n Item description:  \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This is the best children's movie ever.-------\nItem title: Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition) \n Item description: Product Description Amadeus: Special Edition (Dbl DVD) Gripping human drama. Sumptuous period epic. Glorious celebration of the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This marvelous winner of eight Academy Awards(R) portrays the rivalry between the genius Mozart (Tom Hulce) and the jealous court composer (Best Actor Oscar(R) Winner F.Murray Abraham) who may have ruined Mozart's career and shortened his life. ]]> Amazon.com A note-perfect cinematic event whose immortality was assured from its opening night, Amadeus is an unlikely candidate for the director's-cut treatment. Like one of Mozart's operas, the multiple Oscar-winning theatrical version seemed perfectly formed from the outset--ideal casting, costumes, sets, cinematography, lighting, screenplay, music, music, music--so the reinstatement of an extra 20 minutes simply risks adding \"too many notes.\" Yet though this extended cut can hardly be said to improve a picture that needed no improvement, it does at least flesh out a couple of small subplots and shed new light on certain key scenes. Here we learn why Constanze Mozart bears such ill will towards Salieri when she discovers him at her husband's deathbed, and we see deeper into the reasons why Mozart has no students. The structure of the picture is otherwise unaltered. The director's cut of Amadeus finally accords this masterful work the DVD treatment it deserves. The handsome anamorphic widescreen picture is accompanied by a choice of Dolby 5.1 or Dolby stereo sound options, and it's all contained on one side of the disc. Director Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer provide a chatty though sporadic commentary, but they're obviously still too mesmerized by the movie to do much more than offer the odd anecdote. The second disc contains an excellent new hour-long \"making of\" documentary, with contributions from Forman, Shaffer, Sir Neville Marriner, and all the main actors, taking in the scriptwriting, choice of music, casting, and problems involved in filming in Communist Czechoslovakia with half the crew and extras working for the Secret Police. --Mark Walker \n rating: 5.0 \n review: One of the best movies ever made, a classic.-------\nItem title: Monsters, Inc. (Three-Disc Collector's Edition: Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging) \n Item description: Experience the film that captured the hearts of critics and fans around the world in a breathtaking new way. MONSTERS, INC. is \"visually dazzling, action-packed and hilarious,\" raves The Boston Herald. Lovable Sulley (John Goodman) and his wisecracking sidekick Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are the top scare team at Monsters, Inc., the scream-processing factory in Monstropolis. When a little girl named Boo wanders into their world, it's the monsters who are scared silly, and it's up to Sulley and Mike to keep her out of sight and get her back home. Open the door to a phenomenal world of excitement and imagination that will have you screaming for more. Loaded with sensational bonus features, including the theatrical short \"Partysaurus Rex,\" MONSTERS, INC. is hours of fantastic family fun.|MONSTERS, INC., shattered every DVD-era home entertainment sales record when 11 million DVD/VHS copies of the film were sold during its first week of release. Only THE LION KING, released in the \"pre-DVD\" era, sold more units when it debuted on VHS in 1995.|Typically, voice actors record their parts individually and never meet their costars -- but John Goodman and Billy Crystal broke animation protocol for MONSTERS, INC., and recorded their parts at the same time. Says Crystal: \"I did the first session alone ... and I said, 'You know, this is terrible.'\" Director Pete Docter \"kept wanting all different line readings of the same line,\" Crystal says. '\"Why am I doing all of these?' I asked. He said, 'Well, in case I change the scene around, and I'll get John to do it.' I said, 'Isn't that just silly? When we can be together and do it together and play the scenes?' And that's what we did. \"|Singer-songwriter Randy Newman had been nominated for an Academy Award\u00ae 16 times -- and never won -- before he finally won for the song \"If I Didn't Have You.\" \n rating: 5.0 \n review: My kids loved it even though I think they are still scared of the closet. Definitely a must see and worth the money.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I love animated movies that are fun for the whole family, with great visuals and a touch of humor - I'm always looking for the next entertaining movie to watch!\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Bomer returns as suave con man turned FBI consultant Neal Caffrey, racing to stay one step ahead of the feds even as he helps his partner, Agent Peter Burke, bring down some of the world's most clever criminals. The stakes are at an all-time high as Neal struggles to come to terms with his own checkered past, but will his greatest con cost him everything? Amazon.com With his high cheekbones and piercing blue eyes, Matt Bomer plays con man Neal Caffrey with a smooth, handsome gloss. White Collar follows Caffrey's adventures as a sort of indentured servant to the FBI, under the watchful eye of Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay). At the end of the previous season, Caffrey found himself in possession of a trove of classical art recovered from a sunken Nazi U-boat. His moral quandary--whether or not to sell the art and run--is the thread woven throughout the season, tying together assorted single-episode high jinks about stolen objects like an Egyptian scarab amulet or a Stradivarius violin, a forged will that turns out to be a treasure map, and speed dating with a possible black widow murderess. Another element recurring over the course of the season: Both Peter and Neal are deviled by figures from their respective pasts--Peter's former mentor (Beau Bridges) and Neal's former partner (Ross McCall). Lies, false identities, and shifting allegiances are the bread and butter for White Collar . White Collar has a light touch that harks back to '60s and '70s shows like Banacek or It Takes a Thief , with elaborate scams carried out by snappy dressers with a glib comeback to parry any threat. While the emotional stakes are occasionally high for the characters (in one episode, Peter's wife Elizabeth--played by Tiffani Thiessen--is kidnapped, giving DeKay plenty of opportunities for clenched-jaw machismo), a good outcome is never really in doubt for the audience. This is cheerful fun with plenty of eye-candy. Guest appearances included M\u00e4dchen Amick ( Twin Peaks ), Eliza Dushku ( Dollhouse ), Lena Headey ( Game of Thrones ), Dylan Baker ( Happiness ), and Tom Skerritt ( Alien ). --Bret Fetzer \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I love White Collar and got all my friends and family hooked on it too, it's fun to watch it with them and predict what will happen next.

At the end of the previous season, Caffrey found himself in possession of a trove of classical art recovered from a sunken Nazi U-boat. His moral quandary--whether or not to sell the art and run--is the thread woven throughout the season, tying together assorted single-episode high jinks about stolen objects like an Egyptian scarab amulet or a Stradivarius violin, a forged will that turns out to be a treasure map, and speed dating with a possible black widow murderess. Another element recurring over the course of the season: Both Peter and Neal are deviled by figures from their respective pasts--Peter's former mentor (Beau Bridges) and Neal's former partner (Ross McCall). Lies, false identities, and shifting allegiances are the bread and butter for White Collar . White Collar has a light touch that harks back to '60s and '70s shows like Banacek or It Takes a Thief , with elaborate scams carried out by snappy dressers with a glib comeback to parry any threat. While the emotional stakes are occasionally high for the characters (in one episode, Peter's wife Elizabeth--played by Tiffani Thiessen--is kidnapped, giving DeKay plenty of opportunities for clenched-jaw machismo), a good outcome is never really in doubt for the audience. This is cheerful fun with plenty of eye-candy. Guest appearances included M\u00e4dchen Amick ( Twin Peaks ), Eliza Dushku ( Dollhouse ), Lena Headey ( Game of Thrones ), Dylan Baker ( Happiness ), and Tom Skerritt ( Alien ). --Bret Fetzer  rating: 5.0  review: I love White Collar and got all my friends and family hooked on it too, it's fun to watch it with them and predict what will happen next. And I got this season on sale, score! I have all three seasons so far and looking to get the fourth one soon too.-------```And here is the user's intention: Hey, I'm always up for trying new workout DVDs, especially ones that keep things interesting and engaging to help me stay focused and motivated!Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama autobiography, offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voiceover actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years. Barack Obama sold himself to America as the multi-cultural ideal, a man who stood above politics. Was the goat herding Kenyan father only a fairy tale to obscure a Marxist agenda, irreconcilable with American values?This fascinating narrative is based in part on 2 years of research, interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of Davis and Obama himself. Dreams from My Real Father weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic in an attempt to fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for &quot;fundamentally transforming America? Director Joel Gilbert concludes,To understand Obama\u2019s plans for America, the question is \u2019Who is the real father? Review A tour de force that changes our view of the President --Dr. Herbert London, Hudson InstituteA must watch film! Deepens the mystery about who Barack Obama really is, and reveals Obama's deep rooted socialism in past and present! --Dr. Jerome Corsi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I heard a rumor that Frank Marshall Davis is president Obama's real Dad.  I did not believe it at first but I knew he definitely had an influence on Obama's life which is why I purchased this video, to find out more about F.M.D..  After watching this video, comparing facial features on photographs, reexamining his so called step brothers interview I conclude Frank Marshall Davis is Obama's real Dad and Obama Sr. is not his real father.  President Obama knew this since he was 12 years old and deliberately lied to the American people to push his agenda through regardless what the majority want.  This disqualifies president Obama from being a democrat since by definition a democrat is one who listens to the majority and lets the majority rule.  His actions since being in office consistently goes against the grain of a democrat.  If you would like to know who the real Obama is, this video answers many questions.  Thank you-------\nItem title: 2016: Obama\u2019s America \n Item description: Product Description Immersed in exotic locales across four continents, best selling author Dinesh D'Souza races against time to find answers to Obama's past and reveal where America will be in 2016. During this journey he discovers how Hope and Change became radically misunderstood, and identifies new flashpoints for hot wars in mankind's greatest struggle. The journey moves quickly over the arc of the old colonial empires, into America's empire of liberty, and we see the unfolding realignment of nations and the shape of the global future. Amazon.com Watching Dinesh D'Souza's 2016: Obama's America in the wake of the 2012 U.S. presidential election is an interesting experience. Since the film was clearly produced and released (in July '12) with the intention of convincing Americans not to reelect Barack Obama, does the fact that he won anyway render it irrelevant? Or is it a good thing that now that Obama will remain in the White House, we'll have a chance to see if D'Souza's dire predictions about the havoc the president will wreak on the nation (cutting the military, raising taxes, continuing to ignore Iran's nuclear potential, spending money irresponsibly, and so on) will come true? It's the filmmaker's contention that Obama's dreams, aspirations, and values come from his father; although he barely knew Barack Obama Sr., his mother passed on his influence--influence that was largely misguided, as the elder Obama was a radical anti-colonialist whose son has spent his life trying to \"become worthy of his father's love\u2026 the love he never got.\" D'Souza illustrates his thesis by way of reenactments, interviews (including plenty of face time for himself), footage from visits to Kenya (Obama Sr.'s native country) and Indonesia (where the president briefly lived with his mother and stepfather), and excerpts from Obama's first book, Dreams from My Father , read by the president himself. He does his case no favors by not talking to anyone with a differing point of view; at the same time, he tends to prod those he does interview into giving the answers that he wants to hear (\"Do you see Israel as a little colonial power in the Middle East?\" is typical), and his references to \"founding fathers\" of Obama's alleged radicalism (William Ayers, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, et al.) are old and tired. About an hour into the story, having declared the new brand of anti-colonialism (unlike the older kind, which helped India, D'Souza's own homeland, rid itself of the British) to be \"anti-capitalist (and) anti-Christian,\" he declares that Obama \"possesses a Third World, anti-American view.\" At that point, pretty much all pretense of objectivity is abandoned; this is where the true believers will move closer and turn up the volume, while others will turn off their TVs in disgust. That's unfortunate, as the end result will be that those predisposed to mistrust Obama will find nothing to soften their view here; neither will those who think it's nothing but hateful, divisive nonsense. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Dinesh does a great job putting together a film to help explain Obama's worldview for those who were wondering what Obamas worldview is.  Quotes from Obama's own book \"Dream's From My Father\" and interviews many people who had influence on Obama's life which would have impacted his worldview. In my opinion this film is really only for those who asked themselves 'what is Obama's worldview?' and would like to know. This film is not as rewarding for those who do not study politics or thought of worldviews. This film is also good in the sense it gives just enough information so one can do more research on their own such as anti-colonialism or the names of the people Obama was closely affiliated with.  Dinesh research matches another excellent researcher as well such as Trevor Louden who lives in New Zealand.  Dinesh is also originally from outside the U.S. and is from India. Two well respected men.-------\nItem title: The Obama White House Radicals \n Item description: America has come under the rule of the most radical administration in our nation\u2019s history. President Obama has called on Communist sympathizers and supporters of a far-left \"progressive\" agenda to fill high-level positions within his administration. The Obama White House Radicals (DVD) looks at several presidential appointees and exposes their extreme left ideology to show the radical \"change\" the President intends to bring to America.

What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama autobiography, offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voiceover actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years. Barack Obama sold himself to America as the multi-cultural ideal, a man who stood above politics. Was the goat herding Kenyan father only a fairy tale to obscure a Marxist agenda, irreconcilable with American values?This fascinating narrative is based in part on 2 years of research, interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of Davis and Obama himself. Dreams from My Real Father weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic in an attempt to fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for &quot;fundamentally transforming America? Director Joel Gilbert concludes,To understand Obama\u2019s plans for America, the question is \u2019Who is the real father? Review A tour de force that changes our view of the President --Dr. Herbert London, Hudson InstituteA must watch film! Deepens the mystery about who Barack Obama really is, and reveals Obama's deep rooted socialism in past and present! --Dr. Jerome Corsi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I heard a rumor that Frank Marshall Davis is president Obama's real Dad.  I did not believe it at first but I knew he definitely had an influence on Obama's life which is why I purchased this video, to find out more about F.M.D..  After watching this video, comparing facial features on photographs, reexamining his so called step brothers interview I conclude Frank Marshall Davis is Obama's real Dad and Obama Sr. is not his real father.  President Obama knew this since he was 12 years old and deliberately lied to the American people to push his agenda through regardless what the majority want.  This disqualifies president Obama from being a democrat since by definition a democrat is one who listens to the majority and lets the majority rule.  His actions since being in office consistently goes against the grain of a democrat.  If you would like to know who the real Obama is, this video answers many questions.  Thank you-------\nItem title: 2016: Obama\u2019s America \n Item description: Product Description Immersed in exotic locales across four continents, best selling author Dinesh D'Souza races against time to find answers to Obama's past and reveal where America will be in 2016. During this journey he discovers how Hope and Change became radically misunderstood, and identifies new flashpoints for hot wars in mankind's greatest struggle. The journey moves quickly over the arc of the old colonial empires, into America's empire of liberty, and we see the unfolding realignment of nations and the shape of the global future. Amazon.com Watching Dinesh D'Souza's 2016: Obama's America in the wake of the 2012 U.S. presidential election is an interesting experience. Since the film was clearly produced and released (in July '12) with the intention of convincing Americans not to reelect Barack Obama, does the fact that he won anyway render it irrelevant? Or is it a good thing that now that Obama will remain in the White House, we'll have a chance to see if D'Souza's dire predictions about the havoc the president will wreak on the nation (cutting the military, raising taxes, continuing to ignore Iran's nuclear potential, spending money irresponsibly, and so on) will come true? It's the filmmaker's contention that Obama's dreams, aspirations, and values come from his father; although he barely knew Barack Obama Sr., his mother passed on his influence--influence that was largely misguided, as the elder Obama was a radical anti-colonialist whose son has spent his life trying to \"become worthy of his father's love\u2026 the love he never got.\" D'Souza illustrates his thesis by way of reenactments, interviews (including plenty of face time for himself), footage from visits to Kenya (Obama Sr.'s native country) and Indonesia (where the president briefly lived with his mother and stepfather), and excerpts from Obama's first book, Dreams from My Father , read by the president himself. He does his case no favors by not talking to anyone with a differing point of view; at the same time, he tends to prod those he does interview into giving the answers that he wants to hear (\"Do you see Israel as a little colonial power in the Middle East?\" is typical), and his references to \"founding fathers\" of Obama's alleged radicalism (William Ayers, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, et al.) are old and tired. About an hour into the story, having declared the new brand of anti-colonialism (unlike the older kind, which helped India, D'Souza's own homeland, rid itself of the British) to be \"anti-capitalist (and) anti-Christian,\" he declares that Obama \"possesses a Third World, anti-American view.\" At that point, pretty much all pretense of objectivity is abandoned; this is where the true believers will move closer and turn up the volume, while others will turn off their TVs in disgust. That's unfortunate, as the end result will be that those predisposed to mistrust Obama will find nothing to soften their view here; neither will those who think it's nothing but hateful, divisive nonsense. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Dinesh does a great job putting together a film to help explain Obama's worldview for those who were wondering what Obamas worldview is.  Quotes from Obama's own book \"Dream's From My Father\" and interviews many people who had influence on Obama's life which would have impacted his worldview. In my opinion this film is really only for those who asked themselves 'what is Obama's worldview?' and would like to know. This film is not as rewarding for those who do not study politics or thought of worldviews. This film is also good in the sense it gives just enough information so one can do more research on their own such as anti-colonialism or the names of the people Obama was closely affiliated with.  Dinesh research matches another excellent researcher as well such as Trevor Louden who lives in New Zealand.  Dinesh is also originally from outside the U.S. and is from India. Two well respected men.-------\nItem title: The Obama White House Radicals \n Item description: America has come under the rule of the most radical administration in our nation\u2019s history. President Obama has called on Communist sympathizers and supporters of a far-left \"progressive\" agenda to fill high-level positions within his administration. The Obama White House Radicals (DVD) looks at several presidential appointees and exposes their extreme left ideology to show the radical \"change\" the President intends to bring to America. The roster of radicals includes a self-avowed Communist to a member of the Socialist International, and a militant homosexual activist now positioned to target America's schoolchildren with pro-homosexual instruction. The DVD also examines the influence of Rules for Radicals author Saul Alinsky on President Obama\u2019s political education.

Pirates of the Great Salt Lake aims for a Napoleon Dynamite -by-way-of- The Big Lewbowski vibe, in which the weirdest plot twists sit alongside the most mundane stuff of life.

Embark on a thrilling adventure with the most unforgettable characters: Lady, a lovingly pampered cocker spaniel; Tramp, a mutt from across the tracks with a heart of gold; Jock and Trusty, Lady's best friends; and Si and Am, two of the most devious cats to prowl across the screen. The happiest of endings takes place on a lovely bella notte as Lady learns what it means to be footloose and leash-free. Unleash all the fun and excitement in this 2-Disc Special Edition, including never-before-seen deleted scenes, 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, all-new games, making-of secrets, and much more! Amazon.com It's still one of the sweetest kisses onscreen, up there with Bergman and Grant, Bogey and Bacall: the moment when pampered purebred Lady and streetwise mongrel Tramp, sharing a moonlit plate of spaghetti in an alley behind an Italian caf\u00e9, unknowingly slurp the same strand, and suddenly find their mouths meeting in surprise and tenderness. Ah, puppy love. Lady and the Tramp is a delight of animation and surprisingly deep character development, given that the stars are all dogs. Lady, an adorable Cocker Spaniel, feels neglected when her owners become distracted by the pending birth of a baby. But the last straw is clueless Aunt Sarah's appearance with her conniving Siamese cats (among Disney's most creatively evil villains), who wreak havoc on Lady's blissful home life. Soon Lady is off on an adventure in the streets, where the savvy Tramp takes her under his paw. The lessons of friendship and loyalty, of integrity--not to mention trusting in the kindness of strangers--ring true to delighted children and adults alike. And unlike many Disney films, there's no real violence, only challenges that smart dogs (including a tough-talking vamp named Peg, voiced sublimely by Peggy Lee, who also wrote the songs), banding together, can tackle. The animation is terrific; the scene where we first meet Tramp shows him rinsing off under a pipe, and his subsequent shaking-off of the water follows the detailed rippling up and down his back that any dog lover will recognize. And is there any song more romantic than \"Bella Notte\"? Bellissima! --A.T. Hurley Set Contains: The second disc is jam-packed with extras, including deleted scenes (one surreal, extended one in which the dogs imagine that they ruled the world, keeping humans as pets) and lots of behind-the-scenes dish. The story, an original one for Disney, had been kicking around the studio for nearly 20 years before the film was made, and there are great interviews with animators and surviving relatives on the evolution of Lady and of the plot. One priceless episode deconstructs how the evil Siamese cats were created (they were originally named Nip and Tuck), and features a glamorous Peggy Lee, who also cowrote this and other songs in the film, explaining how she dueted with herself playing both cats. Little ones will enjoy the games, including a DVD-ROM in which they can \"adopt\" a puppy and teach him tricks. --A.T. Hurley See more \n rating: 5.0 \n review: The DVD was delivered within four days of purchase with minimal wear and tear. It wasn't scratched at all and I was extremely satisfied with the movie!-------\nItem title: BlacKkKlansman [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Universal Studios BlacKkKlansman (Blu-Ray) \n rating: 4.0 \n review: Was super excited to see this movie because of Adam Driver and the topic seemed interesting--a black guy infiltrating the KKK and making them all look like fools! I thought it was going to be a lot funnier than it was. There were some tiny funny moments but the majority of it was really serious. The previews made it seem like it would be more comedic than drama. However, it was a really good movie and I would recommend to anyone who likes history and a good true story.-------\nItem title: Cinderella (Two-Disc Special Edition) \n Item description: Product Description The most celebrated of all the Disney classics, CINDERELLA, is also known as one of Walt Disney's all-time favorite films. CINDERELLA has enchanted generations with its spellbinding story, charming music, and endearing characters that live in your heart forever. The beloved fairy tale becomes pure Disney magic as beautiful Cinderella shares her dreams of romance and a better life with the lovable mice Gus and Jaq. When Cinderella's cruel stepmother prevents her from attending the Royal Ball, the delightful Fairy Godmother appears! With a wave of her wondrous wand and a bouncy \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" the Fairy Godmother transforms a simple pumpkin into a magical coach -- and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown. At the ball, Cinderella falls in love with Prince Charming, but must flee before the stroke of midnight breaks the spell! Now with an all-new digital restoration, Disney's Enhanced Home Theater Mix, and all-new games and music videos, this 2-Disc Special Edition of Cinderella is the perfect fit for everyone who believes dreams really do come true. Also available on Video. Amazon.com Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fied adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,\" \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. The famous slipper (click for larger image) We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying. --David Kronke DVD Features For another of its classic films, Disney delivers another dazzling DVD with a gorgeous, razor-sharp picture and 5.1 sound. (Note: the 1949 film is properly presented in full-screen format, 1.33 aspect ratio, because widescreen films weren't made until the '50s.) The best part of the supplemental features is the archival material, the absolute highlight of which is two unused songs, \"Cinderella's Work Song\" (in which Cinderella imagines multiplying herself \u00e0 la the Sorcerer's Apprentice) and \"Dancing on a Cloud.\" Bippity-boppity-boo! (click for larger image) Because these numbers were never animated, they're accompanied by stylish illustrations from the Disney artists, and they're simply marvelous to look at. The artist of much of that material, Mary Blair, gets her due in a 15-minute featurette, while the better known \"Nine Old Men\" are the subject of a round-table discussion among some of today's top animators. In addition, a 38-minute documentary covers their contributions to specific characters of Cinderella as well as the film in general and the vocal cast. Also on the historical side is \"The Cinderella That Almost Was,\" tracking the development of the project through decades of original Disney concepts, characters, and songs, including the 1922 silent \"Laugh-o-Gram,\" which is also included in its entirety. The pumpkin transformed (click for larger image) Additional musical material includes three radio programs and a short promo of the movie by Perry Como, in which he summarizes the plot amid some songs by the Fontaine Sisters, star Ilene Woods, and the host himself. Seven other unused songs (17 minutes total) are available in audio-only. The material for kids is on the sparse side, consisting of two music videos, Disney Channel personality Sally (from \"Mike's Super Short Show\") learning how to become a princess with the help of the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition crew and others, a minor dancing-princess feature, and a DVD-ROM design studio. Oddest extra: ESPN's \"top Cinderella stories,\" including the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team and Joe Namath's New York Jets, although stories on Mia Hamm and tennis's Williams sisters should appeal to the film's primary target audience of young girls. --David Horiuchi Cinderella Throughout the Years Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1957 Television Production) Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965) The Slipper and the Rose (1976) Faerie Tale Theatre - Cinderella (1982) Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997) Ever After - A Cinderella Story (1998) \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I love this movie.

This inspiring and revealing drama focuses on the 16th President's tumultuous final four months in office as this visionary leader pursues a course of action to end the Civil War, unite the country and abolish slavery. Complete with never-before-seen footage featuring Steven Spielberg and the cast, who take you deep inside the making of the movie, LINCOLN sheds light on a man of moral courage and fierce determination. Amazon.com View larger View larger View larger View larger As with the great John Ford ( Young Mr. Lincoln ) before him, it would be out of character for Steven Spielberg to construct a conventional, cradle-to-grave portrait of a historical figure. In drawing from Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals , the director instead depicts a career-defining moment in the career of Abraham Lincoln (an uncharacteristically restrained Daniel Day-Lewis). With the Civil War raging, and the death toll rising, the president focuses his energies on passage of the 13th Amendment. Even those sympathetic to the cause question his timing, but Lincoln doesn't see the two issues as separate, and the situation turns personal when his son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), chooses to enlist rather than to study law. While still mourning the loss of one son, Mary (Sally Field) can't bear to lose another. Playwright Tony Kushner, who adapted the screenplay, takes a page from the procedural handbook in tracing Lincoln's steps to win over enough representatives to abolish slavery, while simultaneously bringing a larger-than-life leader down to a more manageable size. In his stooped-shoulder slouch and Columbo-like speech, Day-Lewis succeeds so admirably that the more outspoken characters, like congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) and lobbyist W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), threaten to steal the spotlight whenever they enter the scene, but the levity of their performances provides respite from the complicated strategizing and carnage-strewn battlefields. If Lincoln doesn't thrill like the Kushner-penned Munich , there's never a dull moment--though it would take a second viewing to catch all the political nuances. --Kathleen C.

Amazon.com View larger View larger View larger View larger As with the great John Ford ( Young Mr. Lincoln ) before him, it would be out of character for Steven Spielberg to construct a conventional, cradle-to-grave portrait of a historical figure. In drawing from Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals , the director instead depicts a career-defining moment in the career of Abraham Lincoln (an uncharacteristically restrained Daniel Day-Lewis). With the Civil War raging, and the death toll rising, the president focuses his energies on passage of the 13th Amendment. Even those sympathetic to the cause question his timing, but Lincoln doesn't see the two issues as separate, and the situation turns personal when his son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), chooses to enlist rather than to study law. While still mourning the loss of one son, Mary (Sally Field) can't bear to lose another. Playwright Tony Kushner, who adapted the screenplay, takes a page from the procedural handbook in tracing Lincoln's steps to win over enough representatives to abolish slavery, while simultaneously bringing a larger-than-life leader down to a more manageable size. In his stooped-shoulder slouch and Columbo-like speech, Day-Lewis succeeds so admirably that the more outspoken characters, like congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) and lobbyist W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), threaten to steal the spotlight whenever they enter the scene, but the levity of their performances provides respite from the complicated strategizing and carnage-strewn battlefields. If Lincoln doesn't thrill like the Kushner-penned Munich , there's never a dull moment--though it would take a second viewing to catch all the political nuances. --Kathleen C.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Bleak House \n Description: Product description Bleak House Amazon.com Andrew Davies isn't much of household name in the U.S., but he's the king of the BBC mini-series. His skillfully adapted scripts for Pride & Prejudice (the beloved Colin Firth version) and many, many more are peerless examples of classic novels done right--cunningly edited and shaped to let all the rich emotion and sharp intelligence spill over with zip and vigor. Bleak House is no exception; it's one of the best Dickens adaptations to date. The mini-series form allows Dickens' panoramic view, brimming with eccentric characters and complex turns of plot, to sprawl out without losing an iota of suspense or momentum. Two innocent young orphans (Patrick Kennedy and Carey Mulligan) are the potential heirs to a fortune, but their fates are snarled in a monumental legal battle known as Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But the heart of the story is another orphan, Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin), whose mysterious parentage proves to be intertwined with the fate of the Jarndyce wards and the aloof Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson, The X-Files ). Dickens' story twines through an excoriating vision of the legal system to heartbreaking domestic drama to a murder investigation to near-Gothic horror, all broken into utterly delicious half-hour segments (after the hour-long opening episode). Martin is utterly beguiling, homely at one moment and luminous the next; Anderson's grippingly eerie and brittle performance will delight her fans. But to single out anyone seems absurd, because every character--from the vicious lawyer Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance, White Mischief ) to the foppish parasite Skimpole (Nathaniel Parker, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries ) to the simpering clerk Guppy (Burn Gorman)--is intricately drawn, all hitting a mesmerizing balance between caricature and stark emotional honesty. Bleak House demonstrates that humor, pathos, and social criticism can all be contained in one wonderfully entertaining package. --Bret Fetzer",

It's not long before Barbara and Hazel butt heads after Hazel demonstrates her ability to take over the household as an efficient maid.

I did, immediately, as I had never seen it before.  Was looking for the umbrella skit that I remembered so well as a kid. After a little investigation turns out Shout Factory used the original broadcast opening.  The &#34;umbrella&#34; opening was used as a replacement during the subsequent syndicated broadcasts. So while I was a little disappointed at first it turns out that Shout was just being true to original broadcast. Guess it would have been nice if they had added the sequence in a bonus features menu, by itself, but I'm not complaining.-------\nItem title: Room 222: Season 1 \n Item description: Product description Room 222 S1 Amazon.com From its auspicious pilot episode, Room 222 was in a class by itself, earning an Emmy Award its first season for Outstanding New Series. James L. Brooks, who would graduate to The Mary Tyler Moore Show , Taxi , and The Simpsons , created this groundbreaking dramedy set in integrated Walt Whitman High School in Los Angeles. Anchoring the Grade-A ensemble is the late Lloyd Haines as idealistic history teacher Peter Dixon, who doesn't go by the book. \"The world is being revised,\" he tells his students. \"You'd better be doing some thinking.\" Denise Nicholas costars as compassionate guidance counselor (and Dixon's girlfriend) Liz McIntyre. Michael Constantine earned an Emmy Award as job-weary, but principled principal Mr. Kaufman. Karen Valentine also earned an Emmy as over-eager student teacher Alice Johnson. Rarely seen in syndication, Room 222 is a rediscovered treasure that holds up 40 years later. Episodes deal with such timeless issues as self-esteem (a disruptive student uses humor to mask his loneliness), course relevance (students rebel against their elderly \"Preparation for Marriage\" teacher), school bureaucracy (a prize student reveals he actually lives out of district), and popularity (a new student lies to gain acceptance). Room 222 gets high marks for keeping it real. It tackled some hot button issues of the day, such as race, in an understated and meaningful way (even the laugh track is restrained). When Alice asks Peter if he prefers to be referred to as colored, Negro, or black, he responds, \"I've always preferred 'Pete.'\" Among the standouts in the classroom are Howard Rice as the precocious Richie, David Jolliffe as Bernie with the red afro, Heshimu as militant Jason, and Judy Strangis as shy Helen Loomis. The show also features early appearances by a roster of Most Likely to Succeed candidates, including Teri Garr, Rob Reiner, and Bob Balaban, along with such TV Land faves as William Schallert ( The Patty Duke Show ), Ann Morgan Guilbert (Millie on The Dick Van Dyke Show ), and Bernie Koppell ( Get Smart ). Little, if any, restoration works appears to have been done, but in this case, the washed-out colors and less than crystal audio complement Room 222 's 60s vibe. This set gets extra credit for a nice bonus feature, a series retrospective featuring new interviews with Brooks, his writing partner, Allan Burns, Constantine, and Nicholas. Their affectionate and candid remembrances put this show in the context of the era and restore its legacy as one of TV's smartest, and, for the time, hippest, half hours. --Donald Liebenson \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Ditto to the previous reviewer's remarks.  Shout brought this excellent series back into the daylight to be rediscovered.  The quality is definitely watchable, so if you are a fan to any degree don't be detracted from adding this classic to your collection.<br />I was surprised to learn that Los Angeles High, which served as Walt Whitman High in the series, suffered earthquake damage in the 1970's and subsequent fire.  I read that some reconstructing took place on the school. I went to Google maps to get a street view of the current Los Angeles High and realized the entire original structure must have been demolished as the current school has no resemblance to the original.  Wondering if anyone has the story on this...did they have to take out that beautiful, old structure completely?  I'm a native Californian and have no problem asserting that we have little appreciation or respect for any historic structures here.  Really a shame.  All the more reason to preserve and release classics like Room 222, so we can see what we once had.-------\nItem title: Hawaiian Eye \n Item description:  \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Classic television at its best.

Great personality, sense of humor and a natural in front of the camera.  Locations are interesting with a novel approach to learning about other locations from a sports angle.  Dhani completely throws himself into each cultural experience. I especially got a kick out of the extra challenges he faced, good-naturedly, in the Cambodia episode.  This man has a whole other career waiting for him once he leaves football. I predict we'll be seeing a lot more of him in the future.<br /><br />Interesting locales, challenges, beautiful photography and a host who feels like a best friend--how can you go wrong?

A European tour launches the final season in which Samantha and Darrin encounter the likes of King Henry VIII, the Loch Ness Monster and a Leaning Tower of Pisa that's suddenly standing straight! Back at home, Tabitha faces her first day in school while Adam's witchcraft powers are put to the test. Serena flirts with a wealthy client after losing her powers, and the Stephens family becomes an unlikely host to George and Martha Washington after the first President is arrested for exercising his right to free speech. Look for special guest appearances by Peter Lawford (of the original Rat Pack), Julie Newmar (Catwoman on TV's \"Batman\"), Bernie Kopell (Doc on TV's \"The Love Boat\"), Billie Hayes (Witchiepoo on TV's \"H. R. Pufnstuf\") and Will Geer (Grandpa Walton on TV's \"The Waltons\"). Also returning are se Amazon.com The final season of Bewitched witnesses Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) hobnobbing with historical figures and literary characters--in other words, it's just another year in the life of a suburban witch. In the two-part opener, Sam and her mortal husband, Darrin (Dick Sargent), wind up in 16th-century England--where Henry VIII tries to make Sam his spouse. With help from Sam's mother, Endora (Agnes Moorehead of the electrifying eye shadow), her neck remains intact, and the three return to the era of miniskirts and plaid pants. In the episodes to come, they also mix it up with Hansel and Gretel and George and Martha Washington. After their trip to Europe, daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy) turns a brat into a bullfrog, son Adam (David Lawrence) reveals his powers, cousin Serena (Montgomery in black bouffant) loses hers, and Darrin's ad agency boss, Larry (David White), experiences a Big -like return to youth. Other season 8 regulars include jittery Aunt Esmeralda (Alice Ghostley) and skirt-chasing Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox), while standout guest stars include Batman 's Julie Newmar as a seductive cat lady and H.R. Pufnstuf 's Billie Hayes as a child-eating witch (alas, Bernie \"Doc\" Kopell's over-the-top turn as a hippie warlock is more grating than laugh-generating). If Frank Oz's postmodern take on Bewitched , with Nicole Kidman, boasted superior special effects, the original's low-budget visuals offer half the fun, notably a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Loch Ness monster and visible wires when Grandpapa Maurice (Maurice Evans) makes his grandson levitate. After the fifth season departures of Paul Lynde and Dick York, some of the show's initial lunacy dissipated--airing opposite The Carol Burnett Show and All in the Family certainly didn't help--but this set still offers 26 episodes packed with more creativity than most of the supernatural comedies to follow in its wake. --Kathleen C. Fennessy \n rating: 5.0 \n review: The added touches mean a lot to nostalgic nuts like me. As mentioned by others, the Elizabeth Montgomery intros, the bumpers and the restoring of the ending Screen Gems logo after each episode (which was also included on the 7th season set) are all very cool and add a lot to the whole package.

The incomparable Shirley Booth stars as TV's original wisecracking maid, with Ray Fulmer (The Rogues), Lynn Borden (Frogs), Bobby Buntrock (The Virginian) and Julia Benjamin (The Rockford Files) as the family in her care.  rating: 5.0  review: Feel good classic!<br />Tony, in an earlier review, wondered if anyone else noticed the different opening credits sequence.  I did, immediately, as I had never seen it before.  Was looking for the umbrella skit that I remembered so well as a kid. After a little investigation turns out Shout Factory used the original broadcast opening.  The &#34;umbrella&#34; opening was used as a replacement during the subsequent syndicated broadcasts. So while I was a little disappointed at first it turns out that Shout was just being true to original broadcast. Guess it would have been nice if they had added the sequence in a bonus features menu, by itself, but I'm not complaining.-------Item title: Room 222: Season 1  Item description: Product description Room 222 S1 Amazon.com From its auspicious pilot episode, Room 222 was in a class by itself, earning an Emmy Award its first season for Outstanding New Series. James L. Brooks, who would graduate to The Mary Tyler Moore Show , Taxi , and The Simpsons , created this groundbreaking dramedy set in integrated Walt Whitman High School in Los Angeles. Anchoring the Grade-A ensemble is the late Lloyd Haines as idealistic history teacher Peter Dixon, who doesn't go by the book. \"The world is being revised,\" he tells his students. \"You'd better be doing some thinking.\" Denise Nicholas costars as compassionate guidance counselor (and Dixon's girlfriend) Liz McIntyre. Michael Constantine earned an Emmy Award as job-weary, but principled principal Mr. Kaufman. Karen Valentine also earned an Emmy as over-eager student teacher Alice Johnson. Rarely seen in syndication, Room 222 is a rediscovered treasure that holds up 40 years later. Episodes deal with such timeless issues as self-esteem (a disruptive student uses humor to mask his loneliness), course relevance (students rebel against their elderly \"Preparation for Marriage\" teacher), school bureaucracy (a prize student reveals he actually lives out of district), and popularity (a new student lies to gain acceptance). Room 222 gets high marks for keeping it real. It tackled some hot button issues of the day, such as race, in an understated and meaningful way (even the laugh track is restrained). When Alice asks Peter if he prefers to be referred to as colored, Negro, or black, he responds, \"I've always preferred 'Pete.'\" Among the standouts in the classroom are Howard Rice as the precocious Richie, David Jolliffe as Bernie with the red afro, Heshimu as militant Jason, and Judy Strangis as shy Helen Loomis. The show also features early appearances by a roster of Most Likely to Succeed candidates, including Teri Garr, Rob Reiner, and Bob Balaban, along with such TV Land faves as William Schallert ( The Patty Duke Show ), Ann Morgan Guilbert (Millie on The Dick Van Dyke Show ), and Bernie Koppell ( Get Smart ). Little, if any, restoration works appears to have been done, but in this case, the washed-out colors and less than crystal audio complement Room 222 's 60s vibe. This set gets extra credit for a nice bonus feature, a series retrospective featuring new interviews with Brooks, his writing partner, Allan Burns, Constantine, and Nicholas. Their affectionate and candid remembrances put this show in the context of the era and restore its legacy as one of TV's smartest, and, for the time, hippest, half hours. --Donald Liebenson  rating: 5.0  review: Ditto to the previous reviewer's remarks.  Shout brought this excellent series back into the daylight to be rediscovered.  The quality is definitely watchable, so if you are a fan to any degree don't be detracted from adding this classic to your collection.<br />I was surprised to learn that Los Angeles High, which served as Walt Whitman High in the series, suffered earthquake damage in the 1970's and subsequent fire.  I read that some reconstructing took place on the school. I went to Google maps to get a street view of the current Los Angeles High and realized the entire original structure must have been demolished as the current school has no resemblance to the original.  Wondering if anyone has the story on this...did they have to take out that beautiful, old structure completely?  I'm a native Californian and have no problem asserting that we have little appreciation or respect for any historic structures here.  Really a shame.  All the more reason to preserve and release classics like Room 222, so we can see what we once had.-------Item title: Hawaiian Eye  Item description:   rating: 5.0  review: Classic television at its best.  Acting, sets, costumes, backdrops.  With Warner Brothers celebrating it's 50th year in television right now, I've been hoping to hear of this being released on DVD.  Can anyone out there offer some good news on this?  Amazon customers keep casting your votes so Warner Brothers sees the interest!-------Item title: Dhani Tackles the Globe: Season 1  Item description: Famed NFL linebacker Dhani Jones will need more than shoulder pads where he\u2019s going. He\u2019ll be embarking on a global sports odyssey that will take him from Australia\u2019s shores to the mountains of Switzerland! Being the top athlete he is, he throws himself into everything from Ireland\u2019s hurling to Russia\u2019s Sambo fighting. More than a football player, he\u2019s also a true Renaissance man. He explores each country\u2019s culture by getting to know the locals, taking in the sights and indulging in its cuisine. Experienced by Dhani Jones, this eye-opening, high-energy adventure reveals the world as you\u2019ve never seen it before!  rating: 5.0  review: Dhani Jones really makes this program.  Great personality, sense of humor and a natural in front of the camera.  Locations are interesting with a novel approach to learning about other locations from a sports angle.  Dhani completely throws himself into each cultural experience. I especially got a kick out of the extra challenges he faced, good-naturedly, in the Cambodia episode.  This man has a whole other career waiting for him once he leaves football. I predict we'll be seeing a lot more of him in the future.<br /><br />Interesting locales, challenges, beautiful photography and a host who feels like a best friend--how can you go wrong?  Highly recommended!!-------Item title: Bewitched : Season 8  Item description: Product Description Elizabeth Montgomery twitches up one last round of magic and mayhem in Bewitched: The Complete Eighth & Final Season along with Dick Sargent, Agnes Moorehead and David White. A European tour launches the final season in which Samantha and Darrin encounter the likes of King Henry VIII, the Loch Ness Monster and a Leaning Tower of Pisa that's suddenly standing straight! Back at home, Tabitha faces her first day in school while Adam's witchcraft powers are put to the test. Serena flirts with a wealthy client after losing her powers, and the Stephens family becomes an unlikely host to George and Martha Washington after the first President is arrested for exercising his right to free speech. Look for special guest appearances by Peter Lawford (of the original Rat Pack), Julie Newmar (Catwoman on TV's \"Batman\"), Bernie Kopell (Doc on TV's \"The Love Boat\"), Billie Hayes (Witchiepoo on TV's \"H. R. Pufnstuf\") and Will Geer (Grandpa Walton on TV's \"The Waltons\"). Also returning are se Amazon.com The final season of Bewitched witnesses Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) hobnobbing with historical figures and literary characters--in other words, it's just another year in the life of a suburban witch. In the two-part opener, Sam and her mortal husband, Darrin (Dick Sargent), wind up in 16th-century England--where Henry VIII tries to make Sam his spouse. With help from Sam's mother, Endora (Agnes Moorehead of the electrifying eye shadow), her neck remains intact, and the three return to the era of miniskirts and plaid pants. In the episodes to come, they also mix it up with Hansel and Gretel and George and Martha Washington. After their trip to Europe, daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy) turns a brat into a bullfrog, son Adam (David Lawrence) reveals his powers, cousin Serena (Montgomery in black bouffant) loses hers, and Darrin's ad agency boss, Larry (David White), experiences a Big -like return to youth. Other season 8 regulars include jittery Aunt Esmeralda (Alice Ghostley) and skirt-chasing Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox), while standout guest stars include Batman 's Julie Newmar as a seductive cat lady and H.R. Pufnstuf 's Billie Hayes as a child-eating witch (alas, Bernie \"Doc\" Kopell's over-the-top turn as a hippie warlock is more grating than laugh-generating). If Frank Oz's postmodern take on Bewitched , with Nicole Kidman, boasted superior special effects, the original's low-budget visuals offer half the fun, notably a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Loch Ness monster and visible wires when Grandpapa Maurice (Maurice Evans) makes his grandson levitate. After the fifth season departures of Paul Lynde and Dick York, some of the show's initial lunacy dissipated--airing opposite The Carol Burnett Show and All in the Family certainly didn't help--but this set still offers 26 episodes packed with more creativity than most of the supernatural comedies to follow in its wake. --Kathleen C. Fennessy  rating: 5.0  review: The added touches mean a lot to nostalgic nuts like me. As mentioned by others, the Elizabeth Montgomery intros, the bumpers and the restoring of the ending Screen Gems logo after each episode (which was also included on the 7th season set) are all very cool and add a lot to the whole package.  These classic television show sets sell partly due to the retro appeal (besides their quality entertainment value), thanks Sony for recognizing that!-------Item title: Here Come The Brides: Season 2  Item description: Set in the mid-nineteenth century, this classic TV series revolves around The Bolt brothers (Brown, Sherman and Soul) who own a mountain and logging camp in the rugged landscape of Seattle. As the area's only employer, the brothers borrow money and head east to bring back a shipload of lovely ladies to boost morale. But if any of the women leave Seattle within a year, the Bolts lose their mountain to the man that lent them the money.  rating: 5.0  review: Have watched 2 random episodes so far and am extremely impressed.  Picture quality and DVD packaging are first rate.  Even the Screen Gems logo is intact at the end of each episode so it's all as I remember from decades ago.  Thanks Shout Factory for again demonstrating such integrity in releasing these classic shows so many of us love and treasure.-------```And here is the user's intention: I really enjoy classic TV series and unique film experiences with talented casts, so I'd like to discover something new that captures that same essence.Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives. \n rating: 1.0 \n review: I should have read the reviews before watching this.  It would have saved 73 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  That's how long the movie is, with 11 minutes of credits.<br /><br />The style of the movie is the least of it's problems.  If fact, I liked the style of it.  Seeing things unfold strictly from the video camera's view is interesting, if done well, which this wasn't.<br /><br />First, nobody running for their life is going to care about filming the action so much that they get all of the important parts of the story.  Add to that the uniqueness of the horror, a monster loose in the city, and the brain would probably turn off and think only of survival.<br /><br />Second, the actual story was very thin.  One shot after another of people running every which way with the monster around somewhere.  This was really about the gimmick of seeing the action through the character's video camera.<br /><br />Third, being only 73 minutes long, the inciting moment is about 19 minutes in.  Way too long for nothing to happen.<br /><br />Fourth, the last thing recorded says that 7 hours have elapsed since the monster appeared, but only about 50 minutes is shown.  Why?  Because showing all 7 hours would be boring.  So it's edited even though it is presented as what is on the tape.<br /><br />I could go on, and on, and on.<br /><br />In one of the disc's features the director says that the intent was to give America another iconic monster like Japan's Godzilla, the only other one being King Kong.  What's funny is that the movie isn't really about the monster; it's about the kids with the video camera running around Manhattan!  So he fails to meet his own criteria.<br /><br />Again, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  A complete waste.-------\nItem title: Cheers: Season 6 \n Item description: Product Description Ted Danson, Kirstie Alley, Rhea Perlman. After selling the bar to a large compnay, Sam is back from retirement\" and looking for his old job back-but the new manager isn't going to make it easy for him! 25 episodes on 4 DVDs. 1987-88/color/10 hrs., 14 min/NR/fullscreen. Amazon.com In its sixth season, Cheers introduced its second major--and most significant--cast change. Following the events of season 5 , Sam (Ted Danson) returns from his aborted around-the-world boat trip to find the old gang gone, Carla (Rhea Perlman) and Woody (Woody Harrelson) wearing uniforms more fit for a barbershop quartet, and a tough new boss who reportedly \"eats live sharks for breakfast.\" The new boss, Rebecca (Kirstie Alley, probably best known at the time for her appearance in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and later to anchor such series as Veronica's Closet and Fat Actress ), grudgingly hires back Sam, but has him positively befuddled with her resistance to his masculine wiles. She's not as tough as she seems, however, getting weak in the knees at the thought or sight of her corporate boss, Evan Drake (Tom Skerritt). After the Diane debacle, the irony of the sixth season is that wedding bells are in the air. Carla is on the verge of hitching up with her Boston Bruins boyfried, Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas), until a string of bad luck threatens to tear apart the \"two most superstitious people in the world.\" Then Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) is the victim of a prank that turns serious when he decides to dump live-in psychologist-lover Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) in order to \"pursue the fair Rebecca.\" Other events of the season include Sam as a rapping sportscaster, Sam and Woody being sold in a charity auction, Woody entering a romance with an older woman while dressed up as Mark Twain, and another showdown with Gary's Old Town Tavern. Cheers missed Shelley Long, but it remained a high-quality show; her career missed Cheers infinitely more. --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: While I was a big fan of the show from the start, and it's still one of my favorites, the Sam-Diane relationship was getting pretty tired by the end of the fourth season.  The fifth season was great, but seemed like one long plotline.  A change was desperately needed; that relationship had to be resolved.<br /><br />The Rebecca character made the show fresh again.  While Diane's comedy was intellectual, Rebecca's was more phyical.  Kirstie Alley conveyed more without words with Rebecca than was possible with the Diane character.  Frasier and Lilith took over the intellectual comedy aspect of the show.<br /><br />I don't think the show would have lasted much longer if Diane had not departed.<br /><br />This season is a good introduction to Rebecca with her pathetic crush on her boss, and I always loved Frasier and Lilith.  The episodes are still very funny.  I can't wait for the rest of them.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy movies that have interesting ideas and don't rely solely on special effects, so maybe recommend me something similar to that.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives. \n rating: 1.0 \n review: I should have read the reviews before watching this.  It would have saved 73 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  That's how long the movie is, with 11 minutes of credits.<br /><br />The style of the movie is the least of it's problems.  If fact, I liked the style of it.  Seeing things unfold strictly from the video camera's view is interesting, if done well, which this wasn't.<br /><br />First, nobody running for their life is going to care about filming the action so much that they get all of the important parts of the story.  Add to that the uniqueness of the horror, a monster loose in the city, and the brain would probably turn off and think only of survival.<br /><br />Second, the actual story was very thin.  One shot after another of people running every which way with the monster around somewhere.  This was really about the gimmick of seeing the action through the character's video camera.<br /><br />Third, being only 73 minutes long, the inciting moment is about 19 minutes in.  Way too long for nothing to happen.<br /><br />Fourth, the last thing recorded says that 7 hours have elapsed since the monster appeared, but only about 50 minutes is shown.  Why?  Because showing all 7 hours would be boring.  So it's edited even though it is presented as what is on the tape.<br /><br />I could go on, and on, and on.<br /><br />In one of the disc's features the director says that the intent was to give America another iconic monster like Japan's Godzilla, the only other one being King Kong.  What's funny is that the movie isn't really about the monster; it's about the kids with the video camera running around Manhattan!  So he fails to meet his own criteria.<br /><br />Again, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  A complete waste.-------\nItem title: Cheers: Season 6 \n Item description: Product Description Ted Danson, Kirstie Alley, Rhea Perlman. After selling the bar to a large compnay, Sam is back from retirement\" and looking for his old job back-but the new manager isn't going to make it easy for him! 25 episodes on 4 DVDs. 1987-88/color/10 hrs., 14 min/NR/fullscreen. Amazon.com In its sixth season, Cheers introduced its second major--and most significant--cast change. Following the events of season 5 , Sam (Ted Danson) returns from his aborted around-the-world boat trip to find the old gang gone, Carla (Rhea Perlman) and Woody (Woody Harrelson) wearing uniforms more fit for a barbershop quartet, and a tough new boss who reportedly \"eats live sharks for breakfast.\" The new boss, Rebecca (Kirstie Alley, probably best known at the time for her appearance in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and later to anchor such series as Veronica's Closet and Fat Actress ), grudgingly hires back Sam, but has him positively befuddled with her resistance to his masculine wiles. She's not as tough as she seems, however, getting weak in the knees at the thought or sight of her corporate boss, Evan Drake (Tom Skerritt). After the Diane debacle, the irony of the sixth season is that wedding bells are in the air. Carla is on the verge of hitching up with her Boston Bruins boyfried, Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas), until a string of bad luck threatens to tear apart the \"two most superstitious people in the world.\" Then Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) is the victim of a prank that turns serious when he decides to dump live-in psychologist-lover Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) in order to \"pursue the fair Rebecca.\" Other events of the season include Sam as a rapping sportscaster, Sam and Woody being sold in a charity auction, Woody entering a romance with an older woman while dressed up as Mark Twain, and another showdown with Gary's Old Town Tavern. Cheers missed Shelley Long, but it remained a high-quality show; her career missed Cheers infinitely more. --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: While I was a big fan of the show from the start, and it's still one of my favorites, the Sam-Diane relationship was getting pretty tired by the end of the fourth season.  The fifth season was great, but seemed like one long plotline.  A change was desperately needed; that relationship had to be resolved.<br /><br />The Rebecca character made the show fresh again.  While Diane's comedy was intellectual, Rebecca's was more phyical.  Kirstie Alley conveyed more without words with Rebecca than was possible with the Diane character.  Frasier and Lilith took over the intellectual comedy aspect of the show.<br /><br />I don't think the show would have lasted much longer if Diane had not departed.<br /><br />This season is a good introduction to Rebecca with her pathetic crush on her boss, and I always loved Frasier and Lilith.  The episodes are still very funny.  I can't wait for the rest of them.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy movies that have interesting ideas and don't rely solely on special effects, so maybe recommend me something similar to that.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

But even he could never have imagined how big, when he accepts what appears to be a menial job as a graveyard-shift security guard at a museum of natural history. During Larry's watch, extraordinary things begin to occur: Mayans, Roman Gladiators, and cowboys emerge from their diorama to wage epic battles; in his quest for fire, a Neanderthal burns down his own display; Attila the Hun pillages his neighboring exhibits, and a T-Rex reminds everyone why he's history's fiercest predator. Amidst the chaos, the only person Larry can turn to for advice is a wax figure of President Teddy Roosevelt, who helps our hero harness the bedlam, stop a nefarious plot, and save the museum. Amazon.com An irresistible concept meets computer-generated wonders in Night at the Museum, inspired by a 1993 children's book by Milan Trenc. Ben Stiller stars as Larry Daley, an underachieving inventor waiting for his ship to come in while getting evicted from one apartment after another for lack of funds. Larry's son needs some stability, so the well-meaning ne'er-do-well takes a job as night watchman at New York City's Museum of Natural History. What the soon-to-retire guards (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs) don't tell him is that an ancient pharaoh's tablet in the museum causes everything on display to come to life at night. Thus, Larry meets representations of Teddy Roosevelt, Attila the Hun, fire-worshipping cavemen, and Roman Empire soldiers, and learns to cope with an excitable T-Rex and man-eating, ancient animals. The film might have left things at that, but an added story element gives Night at the Museum some extra urgency and excitement, especially fo! r kids: Larry becomes responsible for keeping this nightly miracle going and preventing anything in the museum from dying due to exposure to sunrise. Computer effects, as well as wildly imaginative costumes and makeup, help make the film appeal to the 8-year-old in everyone.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Bless the Child \n Description: Product description No Description Available. Genre: Feature Film-Drama Rating: R Release Date: 8-AUG-2006 Media Type: DVD Amazon.com When Maggie (Kim Basinger of L.A. Confidential and Batman ) comes home to her apartment building one night, she discovers her estranged, drug-addict sister Jenna huddling in the doorway. Jenna promptly abandons her newborn baby with Maggie, who proceeds to raise the child as her own, despite evidence of autism. But as the little girl, Cody, gets older, what seemed to be autism starts to manifest itself in more startling ways. At the same time, a series of child murders are sweeping the city--murders conducted by a mysterious cult with supernatural matters on their mind. Bless the Child starts promisingly, with subdued, creepy scenes contrasted with more outrageous moments like swarms of computer-generated rats. Fans of religious horror movies will enjoy its twist on The Omen , with an angelic child instead of a demonic one--only the child is still pretty eerie. The special effects go a little overboard towards the end. Jimmy Smits ( Price of Glory ) costars as an FBI cult chaser, and Rufus Sewell ( Dark City , Cold Comfort Farm ) gives a pleasantly restrained performance as the charismatic cult leader. Also featuring Christina Ricci as a cult escapee and Ian Holm as a Jesuit priest. --Bret Fetzer",

The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurrence in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944. Amazon.com When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe with Duel in his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan , his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds. A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winning Schindler's List , but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose. Saving Private Ryan touches us deeper than Schindler because it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make. --Doug Thomas \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Excellent addition to hubby's movie collection.-------\nItem title: Broken Trail [Blu-ray] \n Item description: Top-rated miniseries!

With better escorts of the Destroyer Class, however, German U-Boats have begun to take heavy losses. Das Boot is the story of one such U-Boat crew, with the film examining how these submariners maintained their professionalism as soldiers, attempted to accomplish impossible missions, while all the time attempting to understand and obey the ideology of the government under which they served. Amazon.com This is the restored, 209-minute director's cut of Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing and claustrophobic U-boat thriller, which was theatrically rereleased in 1997. Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (J\u00fcrgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea. Das Boot puts you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen. --Jim Emerson \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Excellent!-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hmm, I really enjoy intense war movies with strong characters and gripping storylines, so maybe recommend me something along those lines!\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Das Boot is the story of one such U-Boat crew, with the film examining how these submariners maintained their professionalism as soldiers, attempted to accomplish impossible missions, while all the time attempting to understand and obey the ideology of the government under which they served. Amazon.com This is the restored, 209-minute director's cut of Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing and claustrophobic U-boat thriller, which was theatrically rereleased in 1997. Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (J\u00fcrgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea. Das Boot puts you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen. --Jim Emerson  rating: 5.0  review: Excellent!-------```And here is the user's intention: Hmm, I really enjoy intense war movies with strong characters and gripping storylines, so maybe recommend me something along those lines!Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Filmed in HD with directors commentary Amazon.com Russian master Alexander Sokurov has tapped into the very flow of history itself for this flabbergasting film. Thanks to the miracles of digital video, Sokurov (and cinematographer Tilman Buttner) uses a single, unbroken, 90-minute shot to wind his way through the Hermitage in St. Petersburg--the repository of Russian art and the former home to royalty. Gliding through time, we glimpse Catherine II, modern-day museumgoers, and the doomed family of Nicholas II. History collapses on itself, as the opulence of the past and the horrors of the 20th century collide, and each door that opens onto yet another breathtaking gallery is another century to be heard from. The movie climaxes with a grand ball and thousands of extras, prompting thoughts of just how crazy Sokurov had to be to try a technical challenge like this--and how far a distance we've traveled, both physically and spiritually, since the movie began. --Robert Horton",

But when the wild night leads them to the most notorious criminal in the city, James will find that his new partner's rapid-fire mouth is just as dangerous as the bullets speeding at it. Also starring John Leguizamo and Laurence Fishburne, Ride Along is an action-packed comedy with big thrills and even bigger laughs. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: It you like comedy this is the one for you-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, I'm looking for a movie that will touch my heart, so recommend me something emotional and heartwarming.\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Lost: Season 5 \n Description: Product Description The epic story of LOST twists, turns and time-shifts in its outstanding fifth season. When destiny calls, the Oceanic 6 find their way back to the island. Discover what forced them to return, and find out the fate of all those who were left behind. The answers to some of LOST's most pressing questions are revealed in this spectacular 5-disc collection, complete with deleted scenes an an incredible vault of exclusive bonus features. The show that revolutionized primetime proves once again why it is television's most addictive and creative series. \"You'd be crazy not to watch,'\" proclaims Matt Roush of TV Guide. Amazon.com Since Lost made its debut as a cult phenomenon in 2004, certain things seemed inconceivable. In its fourth year, some of those things, like a rescue, came to pass. The season ended with Locke (Terry O'Quinn) attempting to persuade the Oceanic Six to return, but he dies before that can happen--or so it appears--and where Jack (Matthew Fox) used to lead, Ben (Emmy nominee Michael Emerson) now takes the reins and convinces the survivors to fulfill Locke's wish. As producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse state in their commentary on the fifth-season premiere, \"We're doing time travel this year,\" and the pile-up of flashbacks and flash-forwards will make even the most dedicated fan dizzy. Ben, Jack, Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun (Yunjin Kim), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) arrive to find that Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) have been part of the Dharma Initiative for three years. The writers also clarify the roles that Richard (Nestor Carbonell) and Daniel (Jeremy Davies) play in the island's master plan, setting the stage for the prophecies of Daniel's mother, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), to play a bigger part in the sixth and final season. Dozens of other players flit in and out, some never to return. A few, such as Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), live again in the past. Lost could've wrapped things up in five years, as The Wire did, but the show continues to excite and surprise. As Lindelof and Cuse admit in the commentary, there's a \"fine line between confusion and mystery,\" adding, \"it makes more sense if you're drunk.\" Other extras include deleted scenes, featurettes, a \"lost\" episode of Mysteries of the Universe , and commentary from writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz on \"He's Our You,\" a reference to Sayid, who tries to change the future by changing the past. --Kathleen C. Fennessy",

Led by Emma Stone, Academy Award\u00ae-nominated Viola Davis (Best Supporting Actress, Doubt, 2008), Octavia Spencer and Bryce Dallas Howard, The Help is an inspirational, courageous and empowering story about very different, extraordinary women in the 1960s South who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project \u2014 one that breaks society\u2019s rules and puts them all at risk. Filled with poignancy, humor and hope \u2014 and complete with compelling, never-before-seen bonus features \u2014 The Help is a timeless, universal and triumphant story about the ability to create change. Amazon.com There are male viewers who will enjoy The Help , but Mississippi native Tate Taylor aims his adaptation squarely at the female readers who made Kathryn Stockett's novel a bestseller. If the multi-character narrative revolves around race relations in the Kennedy-era South, the perspective belongs to the women. Veteran maid Aibileen ( Doubt 's Viola Davis in an Oscar-worthy performance) provides the heartfelt narration that brackets the story. A widow devastated by the death of her son, she takes pride in the 17 children she has helped to raise, but she's hardly fulfilled. That changes when Skeeter ( Easy A 's Emma Stone) returns home after college. Unlike her peers, Skeeter wants to work, so she gets a job as a newspaper columnist. But she really longs to write about Jackson's domestics, so she meets with Aibileen in secret--after much cajoling and the promise of anonymity. When Aibileen's smart-mouthed friend Minny (breakout star Octavia Spencer) breaches her uptight employer's protocol, Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) gives her the boot, and she ends up in the employ of local outcast Celia (Jessica Chastain, hilarious and heartbreaking), who can't catch a break due to her dirt-poor origins. After the murder of Medgar Evers, even more maids, Minny among them, bring their stories to Skeeter, leading to a book that scandalizes the town--in a good way. Not since Steel Magnolias has Hollywood produced a Southern woman's picture more likely to produce buckets of tears (and almost as many laughs). --Kathleen C.

Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest, Transformers . Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar. Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones like Raiders of the Lost Ark , King Kong , and the early technothriller WarGames . The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! - -A.T. Hurley Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Pure. Popcorn. Entertainment. That's an exact classification of director Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen . Think of Transformers 1 on crack. In other words, this sequel took all of the extreme elements that made fans love the first movie and increased them exponentially. The action is nonstop, with battles and explosions from start to finish. The camera (without any subtlety) exploits Megan Fox's hotness to the max. As if she weren't enough, a new sex kitten (Isabel Lucas) is thrown into the equation. Shia LaBeouf is as charismatic as ever, and fills the starring role with ease. And then there's the humor. Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White)provided some semi-raunchy laugh-out-loud moments in the first movie, but now they take it to the next level. Sometimes it seems like they are trying a little too hard, but it is still hilarious. As far as the \u201cplot\u201d goes, the writers didn't waste much time--it's really just a context for the giant-robot death matches and dramatic slow-mo sequences. The movie kicks off two years later where the Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. government, creating an elite team led by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel), in an effort to snuff out any remaining Decepticons that show up. The bad guys keep coming, and it turns out that a much more menacing force than Megatron is out there--and it is looking for something on Earth that is tied to the very origin of the Transformers race. Fans of the franchise will be delighted by the addition of many new robot characters (there are well over 40 in the sequel, versus only 13 in the first). The second Transformers has shaped up to be one of the worst reviewed and most successful movies of all time. This strange pairing is really just an indication that this movie has one purpose: to entertain. The creators didn't want to waste time bogging down the action and drama with substance--which was arguably a good decision. --Jordan Thompson Transformers: Dark of the Moon Talk about \"transforming.\" Michael Bay tested the patience of even the most devoted Transformers fan with the second installment of the franchise, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , but the hyperactive director bounces back in energetic form with number three, Transformers: Dark of the Moon . From the long opening sequence (a zany alternate-history reading of the NASA moon program, complete with cameos by John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon) through the predictably extended action climax, Bay is actually on his best behavior. Sure, his taste is as vulgar as ever (is introducing your leading lady via a lingering butt shot part of the director's personal signature?), but the story line is streamlined and the action is coherent: the constant chop-chop of the fighting sequences in Revenge is gone, replaced by a long-take approach that actually shows us who's fighting who. Plus, it's hard to resist a tilting skyscraper that allows the protagonists to slide down its glassy exterior. I know, right? Shia LaBeouf returns, armed with a new and improbably bodacious girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley); although initially unemployed, he's drawn back into protecting the planet from giant outer-space robots, as the Decepticons menace the Earth once again. John Turturro and Josh Duhamel return to help, and Frances McDormand and John Malkovich join the club. Let's reduce critical expectations and say that if you're going to make a dumb movie about mass destruction, this is the way to do it (and if that sounds like faint praise, compare the movie to its abysmal predecessor). Throw in Hangover funnyman Ken Jeong, computer nerd Alan Tudyk doing a German accent, and the voice of Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime, and you've got yourself a three-ring circus of extremely spirited nonsense. Just how Michael Bay wants it. --Robert Horton \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Just recieved this item via ups. The box itself is very impressive and the packing it was in was very protective.

Hurley Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Pure. Popcorn. Entertainment. That's an exact classification of director Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen . Think of Transformers 1 on crack. In other words, this sequel took all of the extreme elements that made fans love the first movie and increased them exponentially. The action is nonstop, with battles and explosions from start to finish. The camera (without any subtlety) exploits Megan Fox's hotness to the max. As if she weren't enough, a new sex kitten (Isabel Lucas) is thrown into the equation. Shia LaBeouf is as charismatic as ever, and fills the starring role with ease. And then there's the humor. Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White)provided some semi-raunchy laugh-out-loud moments in the first movie, but now they take it to the next level. Sometimes it seems like they are trying a little too hard, but it is still hilarious. As far as the \u201cplot\u201d goes, the writers didn't waste much time--it's really just a context for the giant-robot death matches and dramatic slow-mo sequences. The movie kicks off two years later where the Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. government, creating an elite team led by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel), in an effort to snuff out any remaining Decepticons that show up. The bad guys keep coming, and it turns out that a much more menacing force than Megatron is out there--and it is looking for something on Earth that is tied to the very origin of the Transformers race. Fans of the franchise will be delighted by the addition of many new robot characters (there are well over 40 in the sequel, versus only 13 in the first). The second Transformers has shaped up to be one of the worst reviewed and most successful movies of all time. This strange pairing is really just an indication that this movie has one purpose: to entertain. The creators didn't want to waste time bogging down the action and drama with substance--which was arguably a good decision. --Jordan Thompson Transformers: Dark of the Moon Talk about \"transforming.\" Michael Bay tested the patience of even the most devoted Transformers fan with the second installment of the franchise, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , but the hyperactive director bounces back in energetic form with number three, Transformers: Dark of the Moon . From the long opening sequence (a zany alternate-history reading of the NASA moon program, complete with cameos by John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon) through the predictably extended action climax, Bay is actually on his best behavior. Sure, his taste is as vulgar as ever (is introducing your leading lady via a lingering butt shot part of the director's personal signature?), but the story line is streamlined and the action is coherent: the constant chop-chop of the fighting sequences in Revenge is gone, replaced by a long-take approach that actually shows us who's fighting who. Plus, it's hard to resist a tilting skyscraper that allows the protagonists to slide down its glassy exterior. I know, right? Shia LaBeouf returns, armed with a new and improbably bodacious girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley); although initially unemployed, he's drawn back into protecting the planet from giant outer-space robots, as the Decepticons menace the Earth once again. John Turturro and Josh Duhamel return to help, and Frances McDormand and John Malkovich join the club. Let's reduce critical expectations and say that if you're going to make a dumb movie about mass destruction, this is the way to do it (and if that sounds like faint praise, compare the movie to its abysmal predecessor). Throw in Hangover funnyman Ken Jeong, computer nerd Alan Tudyk doing a German accent, and the voice of Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime, and you've got yourself a three-ring circus of extremely spirited nonsense. Just how Michael Bay wants it. --Robert Horton \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Just recieved this item via ups. The box itself is very impressive and the packing it was in was very protective. Note: Be very careful when removing the tape over the Blu ray discs that the manufacturer put on. On the first transformers movie it did peel some of the disc top layer off but I had read on forums that this should not affect the play back. If that is the case I'm jumping for joy! Michael Bay and his team did a great job putting this collectors box set together and reccomend it to everyone young and old!-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, I love action-packed movies with great visuals and exciting storylines, so if you have any recommendations in that genre, I'm all ears!\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Just as the G-Force -- an elite team of highly trained guinea pigs -- is about to save the world, the F.B.I. shuts the secret unit down. But these next-generation action heroes -- Darwin, loyal team leader; Blaster, weapons expert with attitude to spare; Juarez, drop-dead gorgeous martial arts diva; and tag-along Hurley -- won't be stopped. Armed with the latest in high-tech spy equipment, and with the F.B.I. on their tails, the fur flies as they race against the clock to save the world. From the producer of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy and NATIONAL TREASURE, and filled with high-octane action, daredevil stunts, cutting edge special effects and outrageous comedy, G-FORCE is fantastic fun for the whole family. Amazon.com G-Force just might be the best Jerry Bruckheimer action film in many a moon. The film is exuberant, and its premise--don't think big for an animated caper film, think small --brilliantly upends the more-bigger-faster trope of American action films\u2026 with cute, little, furry guinea pigs. Bruckheimer, the action genius behind the likes of the Pirates of the Caribbean , Con Air , The Rock , Armageddon , and many more, here teams with visual effects maestro Hoyt Yeatman, who writes and directs. The combo is potent, and the fact that they streamed their blow-'em-up vision through a film about tiny rodents saving the world makes the whole confection a hilarious family-friendly experience as well as a satisfying action adventure. The premise isn't earth-shattering: oddball, unexpected heroes are called on to save the day ( Men in Black , Underdog , etc.). But the lowly guinea pig has been long overdue to get its moment in the spotlight. And now the free world knows whom it can really trust. The film mixes the animated heroes with real-life actors, including the sardonic British character actor Bill Nighy, who plays an evil mogul out to take over and/or destroy the world. The U.S. government, it turns out, has been nurturing a special squad for occasions just such as this. It's just that it's been nurturing them in small pens with wood shavings on the floor and running wheels for exercise. Will Arnett, deadpan and spot-on, plays the human agent who has the unenviable task of wrangling the guinea pig G-Force, and is a deft foil for the bad guys as well as for the mini-heroes. But the true powerhouse acting belongs to those giving voices to the guinea pig agents, including Sam Rockwell, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Steve Buscemi, and, as the voice of a domesticated layabout, Jon Favreau. The film's standout, though, is Tracy Morgan, whose Agent Blaster is bellicose, fearless, and as full of malapropisms as Morgan's character on 30 Rock . (In fact, the viewer keeps half-expecting Blaster to turn to Cruz's female agent, Juarez, and yell \"Liz Lemon!\") G-Force is full of belly laughs for kids, as well as their action-film-fan parents. --A.T. Hurley Stills from G-Force (Click for larger image) \n rating: 1.0 \n review: I thought this would be an interesting kids movie, but it is not worth watching. Don't waste your time.

Just as the G-Force -- an elite team of highly trained guinea pigs -- is about to save the world, the F.B.I. shuts the secret unit down. But these next-generation action heroes -- Darwin, loyal team leader; Blaster, weapons expert with attitude to spare; Juarez, drop-dead gorgeous martial arts diva; and tag-along Hurley -- won't be stopped. Armed with the latest in high-tech spy equipment, and with the F.B.I. on their tails, the fur flies as they race against the clock to save the world. From the producer of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy and NATIONAL TREASURE, and filled with high-octane action, daredevil stunts, cutting edge special effects and outrageous comedy, G-FORCE is fantastic fun for the whole family. Amazon.com G-Force just might be the best Jerry Bruckheimer action film in many a moon. The film is exuberant, and its premise--don't think big for an animated caper film, think small --brilliantly upends the more-bigger-faster trope of American action films\u2026 with cute, little, furry guinea pigs. Bruckheimer, the action genius behind the likes of the Pirates of the Caribbean , Con Air , The Rock , Armageddon , and many more, here teams with visual effects maestro Hoyt Yeatman, who writes and directs. The combo is potent, and the fact that they streamed their blow-'em-up vision through a film about tiny rodents saving the world makes the whole confection a hilarious family-friendly experience as well as a satisfying action adventure. The premise isn't earth-shattering: oddball, unexpected heroes are called on to save the day ( Men in Black , Underdog , etc.). But the lowly guinea pig has been long overdue to get its moment in the spotlight. And now the free world knows whom it can really trust. The film mixes the animated heroes with real-life actors, including the sardonic British character actor Bill Nighy, who plays an evil mogul out to take over and/or destroy the world. The U.S. government, it turns out, has been nurturing a special squad for occasions just such as this. It's just that it's been nurturing them in small pens with wood shavings on the floor and running wheels for exercise. Will Arnett, deadpan and spot-on, plays the human agent who has the unenviable task of wrangling the guinea pig G-Force, and is a deft foil for the bad guys as well as for the mini-heroes. But the true powerhouse acting belongs to those giving voices to the guinea pig agents, including Sam Rockwell, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Steve Buscemi, and, as the voice of a domesticated layabout, Jon Favreau. The film's standout, though, is Tracy Morgan, whose Agent Blaster is bellicose, fearless, and as full of malapropisms as Morgan's character on 30 Rock . (In fact, the viewer keeps half-expecting Blaster to turn to Cruz's female agent, Juarez, and yell \"Liz Lemon!\") G-Force is full of belly laughs for kids, as well as their action-film-fan parents. --A.T.

The film's simple story allows for exceptionally creative action sequences about every three to four minutes, while simultaneously building a noble tale full of faith, love, and sacrifice. A beautiful female warrior named Yeonsoha (Yoon So-yi) goes in search of the last, living prince of the Balhae dynasty and its kingdom, overrun years before by the Geordan empire. The prince, Jeong Hyeon (Seo Jin Lee), has been in hiding 14 years as a black market trader, concerned primarily for his own safety and deeply cynical about any thought of going back to retrieve his family's throne. Yeonsoha, however, proves persuasive, especially in light of the many attempts on Jeong's life by a gang of assassins. The shady killers are led by a vengeance-seeking Kun (Hyeong Jun-Shin) and his assistant, (Ki-Yong Lee), another sword-wielding babe who gets into plenty of wild skirmishes with Yeonsoha. The story essentially follows Jeong and Yeonsoha's efforts to get back to a waiting army of Balhae exiles awaiting a king's leadership. As the hours and days pass, Jeong gets in touch with the man he once was, a fearless warrior whose exploits on the battlefield are well-known to Yeonsoha, whose connection to the prince seems mysteriously personal. The film's numerous fight scenes are never redundant, employing all manner of props and ideas for exciting fights.

K, Eun-pyo meets his old friend, KIM Su-hyeok (KO Soo), whom Eun-pyo thought was dead. Once a soft-hearted student, Su-hyeok has been promoted to a lieutenant from a private in two years, and he is now practically the leader of the Alligator Company. In contrast to their fierce reputation, the Alligators sometimes wear the North Korean army's uniform over their uniforms as a protection to cold weather. And a twenty-year-old captain leads the troops. All these raise doubts about the Alligators. While Eun-pyo is confused by his old friend and the suspicious company, he and Su-hyeok are sent to retake the hill. But due to the new company commander's risky strategy, the unit faces a huge crisis. They manage to escape by the strategy of young Captain SHIN Il-yeong (LEE Je-hoon) and Su-hyeok. The company commander is irritated by the Alligators who are always against him.

A group of corrupt cops and elected officials begin conspiring to have the district redeveloped by destructive means - a proposed nuclear air-strike. Damian and Leito must join forces again. \"With bone crunching fights and death defying leaps, this adrenaline charged follow-up takes the groundbreaking parlor action from District B13 to thrilling new heights.\" (Fangoria) Amazon.com Get ready to chase across rooftops, shatter plate-glass windows, and vanquish the enemy with a priceless van Gogh canvas (explanation forthcoming): the agile battlers from District B13 (a.k.a. Banlieue 13 ) are back. As played by David Belle (one of the inventors of the building-hopping practice called parkour) and Cyril Raffaelli, the two expert head-knockers from the first film return to fight yet another serious threat against the walled-off neighborhood in a slightly futuristic Paris. This time some corrupt government officials have a devious plot to raze the slum and funnel the rebuilding contracts to their payoff-happy corporate pals at Harriburton (a name that bears absolutely no resemblance to any real-life corporate behemoth). Wisely delaying the reunion of our heroes, the movie opens with Raffaelli's epic throw-down against a gang of desperadoes, which he executes while wielding the van Gogh painting as a shield/weapon. Nice. Then Belle gets onstage for a typically graceful parkour workout across various buildings. This action, especially in its overblown, belief-defying later stages, has more than its share of fromage , but isn't that what we expect from writer-producer Luc Besson? Ultimatum isn't as sleek and effective as the first movie, but it has enough deft action and buddy-picture one-liners to justify its existence--and Belle and Raffaelli bristle with real movie-star appeal, especially when doing their Butch-and-Sundance routine.

The film's numerous fight scenes are never redundant, employing all manner of props and ideas for exciting fights. But it's the performances that really hold everything together, the deep if understated emotions and the excitement of watching two mismatched lead characters slowly realize how important they are to one another. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: excellent-------\nItem title: Front Line \n Item description: Product Description In February 1951, in Korea, while the armistice negotiation still faces difficulties, the battle continues in the Eastern front line, on the Aero.K. a company commander of the South Korean army dies in battle, and the bullet found in his body belongs to the South Korean army. Lieutenant of the Defense Security Command KANG Eun-pyo (SHIN Ha-kyun) is sent to the Eastern front line to investigate if this is related to any collusion with the enemy. In the Aero. K, Eun-pyo meets his old friend, KIM Su-hyeok (KO Soo), whom Eun-pyo thought was dead. Once a soft-hearted student, Su-hyeok has been promoted to a lieutenant from a private in two years, and he is now practically the leader of the Alligator Company. In contrast to their fierce reputation, the Alligators sometimes wear the North Korean army's uniform over their uniforms as a protection to cold weather. And a twenty-year-old captain leads the troops. All these raise doubts about the Alligators. While Eun-pyo is confused by his old friend and the suspicious company, he and Su-hyeok are sent to retake the hill. But due to the new company commander's risky strategy, the unit faces a huge crisis. They manage to escape by the strategy of young Captain SHIN Il-yeong (LEE Je-hoon) and Su-hyeok. The company commander is irritated by the Alligators who are always against him. He threatens to kill Sergeant OH Gi-yeong (RYU Seung-soo) who disobeys his order while they are battling against the Chinese army. Right at that moment, Su-hyeok shoots the company commander without hesitation. Su-hyeok and his troops are not startled to see their superior die before their eyes. Eun-pyo is taken aback by the situation.

WUTANG aka SHAOLIN & WUTANG Description: A Manchu Prince (Lung Wei Wang) uses trickery to coax the secret fighting skills out of the Shaolin and Wu Tang masters. He then creates a rift between two young students (Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng) who were once the best of friends despite their respective backgrounds, forcing the two disciples to return to their temples and seek advice from their superiors.

A group of corrupt cops and elected officials begin conspiring to have the district redeveloped by destructive means - a proposed nuclear air-strike. Damian and Leito must join forces again. \"With bone crunching fights and death defying leaps, this adrenaline charged follow-up takes the groundbreaking parlor action from District B13 to thrilling new heights.\" (Fangoria) Amazon.com Get ready to chase across rooftops, shatter plate-glass windows, and vanquish the enemy with a priceless van Gogh canvas (explanation forthcoming): the agile battlers from District B13 (a.k.a. Banlieue 13 ) are back. As played by David Belle (one of the inventors of the building-hopping practice called parkour) and Cyril Raffaelli, the two expert head-knockers from the first film return to fight yet another serious threat against the walled-off neighborhood in a slightly futuristic Paris. This time some corrupt government officials have a devious plot to raze the slum and funnel the rebuilding contracts to their payoff-happy corporate pals at Harriburton (a name that bears absolutely no resemblance to any real-life corporate behemoth). Wisely delaying the reunion of our heroes, the movie opens with Raffaelli's epic throw-down against a gang of desperadoes, which he executes while wielding the van Gogh painting as a shield/weapon. Nice. Then Belle gets onstage for a typically graceful parkour workout across various buildings. This action, especially in its overblown, belief-defying later stages, has more than its share of fromage , but isn't that what we expect from writer-producer Luc Besson? Ultimatum isn't as sleek and effective as the first movie, but it has enough deft action and buddy-picture one-liners to justify its existence--and Belle and Raffaelli bristle with real movie-star appeal, especially when doing their Butch-and-Sundance routine. The ending suggests another sequel will need to have a very different setting, but that might not be such a bad thing. --Robert Horton \n rating: 5.0 \n review: excellent-------\nItem title: Swelter \n Item description: Product Description Ten years ago, a bank-robbing team stole $100 million from a Vegas casino.

He is overlooked by his boss (Wallace Shawn) and colleagues, scorned by his mother, and ignored by Hannah (Wasikowska), the lovely copy room girl he pines for. Undermined and undervalued everywhere he turns, it seems that his directionless life couldn't get any worse-until the arrival of James Simon, his new co-worker. James is both Simon's exact physical double and his opposite-confident, charismatic and seductive with women. To Simon's horror, James slowly starts taking over his life. British director Richard Ayoade returns with this darkly comic adaptation of Dostoevsky's novella, featuring a tour de force dual performance from Jesse Eisenberg and co-starring Mia Wasikowska, alongside a strong ensemble cast including Wallace Shawn, Noah Taylor and Cathy Moriarty. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: excellent-------\nItem title: Flying Guillotine 2 \n Item description: Finally available after 25 years, the restored version of the martial arts classic about a kung fu expert, The One Armed Boxer, who takes on the archvillain, the blind Master of The Flying Guillotine.

Up follows the uplifting tale of 78-year-old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who finally fulfills his lifelong dream of a great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and flies away to the wilds of South America. But he discovers all too late that his biggest nightmare has stowed away on the trip an overly optimistic 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Their journey to a lost world, where they encounter some strange, exotic and surprising characters, is filled with hilarity, emotion and wildly imaginative adventure. Amazon.com At a time when too many animated films consist of anthropomorphized animals cracking sitcom one-liners and flatulence jokes, the warmth, originality, humor, and unflagging imagination of Up feel as welcome as rain in a desert. Carl Fredericksen (voice by Ed Asner) ranks among the most unlikely heroes in recent animation history. A 78- year-old curmudgeon, he enjoyed his modest life as a balloon seller because he shared it with his adventurous wife Ellie (Ellie Docter). But she died, leaving him with memories and the awareness that they never made their dream journey to Paradise Falls in South America. When well-meaning officials consign Carl to Shady Oaks Retirement Home, he rigs thousands of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. The journey's scarcely begun when he discovers a stowaway: Russell (Jordan Nagai), a chubby, maladroit Wilderness Explorer Scout who's out to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge. In the tropical jungle, Carl and Russell find more than they bargained for: Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a crazed explorer whose newsreels once inspired Carl and Ellie; Kevin, an exotic bird with a weakness for chocolate; and Dug (Bob Peterson), an endearingly dim golden retriever fitted with a voice box. More importantly, the travelers discover they need each other: Russell needs a (grand)father figure; Carl needs someone to enliven his life without Ellie. Together, they learn that sharing ice-cream cones and counting the passing cars can be more meaningful than feats of daring-do and distant horizons. Pete Docter ( Monsters, Inc . ) and Bob Peterson direct the film with consummate skill and taste, allowing the poignant moments to unfold without dialogue to Michael Giacchnio's vibrant score. Building on their work in The Incredibles and Ratatouille , the Pixar crew offers nuanced animation of the stylized characters. Even by Pixar's elevated standards, Up is an exceptional film that will appeal of audiences of all ages.

When peace breaks out in America, killing machine Major Benson Winifred Payne (Wayans) of the United States Marine Corps Special Forces is given his marching orders\u2026to the unemployment line. Unable to cope with civilian life, Payne is thrust back into the military regimen as commander of the Madison Academy Junior ROTC. How does the military's most dangerous secret weapon discipline a few good men when none of them are even old enough to shave? Any way he wants! At least until the school counselor, Dr. Emily Walburn (Karen Parsons), joins his tour of duty\u2026 Bonus Content: Production Notes Production Notes Cast and Filmmakers Cast and Filmmakers Theatrical Trailer Theatrical Trailer ]]> Amazon.com Let's face facts here: You don't watch a movie like Major Payne for its artistic merit any more than you'd watch Schindler's List for its comedy. If you go in thinking otherwise, you're bucking for a disappointment. So it's a pleasant surprise to discover that Major Payne is more entertaining than a barrel full of bad reviews would lead you to believe. It's a totally formulaic comedy about a bunch of misfit kids who turn into a crack squad of skillfully disciplined ROTC cadets, but Damon Wayans is spot-on hilarious in the title role as the hardened military bulldog who whips the little slackers into shape. Wayans plays the role as if killing and warfare were the only joys in life, and when he finds himself cast adrift without a military commission, a scene that directly parodies Apocalypse Now lets you know that Wayans (who cowrote the script) is going to bring something new to this routine scenario. Major Payne's idea of a good bedtime story is to recall his worst battlefield horrors, and Wayans gives it just the right twist of comedy to put Payne's bullet-pierced heart in the right place--he's really just a good guy with an iron-clad exterior. The young recruits strut their stuff in the final round of their cadet competition (their marching rap is good for a solid laugh), and director Nick Castle keeps it all from becoming too stupid or over the top. It's arguably only for Wayans's most ardent fans, but as a send-up of all the great movie drill instructors, Major Payne is painlessly enjoyable. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great quality-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy action-packed movies with great fight sequences and thrilling chase scenes, so I'm looking for something that will keep me on the edge of my seat like the previous ones.

Up follows the uplifting tale of 78-year-old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who finally fulfills his lifelong dream of a great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and flies away to the wilds of South America. But he discovers all too late that his biggest nightmare has stowed away on the trip an overly optimistic 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Their journey to a lost world, where they encounter some strange, exotic and surprising characters, is filled with hilarity, emotion and wildly imaginative adventure. Amazon.com At a time when too many animated films consist of anthropomorphized animals cracking sitcom one-liners and flatulence jokes, the warmth, originality, humor, and unflagging imagination of Up feel as welcome as rain in a desert. Carl Fredericksen (voice by Ed Asner) ranks among the most unlikely heroes in recent animation history. A 78- year-old curmudgeon, he enjoyed his modest life as a balloon seller because he shared it with his adventurous wife Ellie (Ellie Docter). But she died, leaving him with memories and the awareness that they never made their dream journey to Paradise Falls in South America. When well-meaning officials consign Carl to Shady Oaks Retirement Home, he rigs thousands of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. The journey's scarcely begun when he discovers a stowaway: Russell (Jordan Nagai), a chubby, maladroit Wilderness Explorer Scout who's out to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge. In the tropical jungle, Carl and Russell find more than they bargained for: Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a crazed explorer whose newsreels once inspired Carl and Ellie; Kevin, an exotic bird with a weakness for chocolate; and Dug (Bob Peterson), an endearingly dim golden retriever fitted with a voice box. More importantly, the travelers discover they need each other: Russell needs a (grand)father figure; Carl needs someone to enliven his life without Ellie. Together, they learn that sharing ice-cream cones and counting the passing cars can be more meaningful than feats of daring-do and distant horizons. Pete Docter ( Monsters, Inc . ) and Bob Peterson direct the film with consummate skill and taste, allowing the poignant moments to unfold without dialogue to Michael Giacchnio's vibrant score. Building on their work in The Incredibles and Ratatouille , the Pixar crew offers nuanced animation of the stylized characters. Even by Pixar's elevated standards, Up is an exceptional film that will appeal of audiences of all ages. Rated PG for some peril and action. -- Charles Solomon Stills from Up (Click for larger image) \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great quality-------\nItem title: The Lake House (Full Screen Edition) \n Item description: A lonely doctor (Sandra Bullock) who once occupied an unusual lakeside home begins exchanging love letters with its newest resident, a frustrated architect (Keanu Reeves). When they discover that they're actually living two years apart, they must try to unravel the mystery behind their extraordinary romance before it's too late. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great quality-------\nItem title: Major Payne [DVD] \n Item description: Product Description Damon Wayans stars in Major Payne, a hilarious escapade that commands laughs aplenty! When peace breaks out in America, killing machine Major Benson Winifred Payne (Wayans) of the United States Marine Corps Special Forces is given his marching orders\u2026to the unemployment line. Unable to cope with civilian life, Payne is thrust back into the military regimen as commander of the Madison Academy Junior ROTC. How does the military's most dangerous secret weapon discipline a few good men when none of them are even old enough to shave? Any way he wants! At least until the school counselor, Dr. Emily Walburn (Karen Parsons), joins his tour of duty\u2026 Bonus Content: Production Notes Production Notes Cast and Filmmakers Cast and Filmmakers Theatrical Trailer Theatrical Trailer ]]> Amazon.com Let's face facts here: You don't watch a movie like Major Payne for its artistic merit any more than you'd watch Schindler's List for its comedy. If you go in thinking otherwise, you're bucking for a disappointment. So it's a pleasant surprise to discover that Major Payne is more entertaining than a barrel full of bad reviews would lead you to believe. It's a totally formulaic comedy about a bunch of misfit kids who turn into a crack squad of skillfully disciplined ROTC cadets, but Damon Wayans is spot-on hilarious in the title role as the hardened military bulldog who whips the little slackers into shape. Wayans plays the role as if killing and warfare were the only joys in life, and when he finds himself cast adrift without a military commission, a scene that directly parodies Apocalypse Now lets you know that Wayans (who cowrote the script) is going to bring something new to this routine scenario. Major Payne's idea of a good bedtime story is to recall his worst battlefield horrors, and Wayans gives it just the right twist of comedy to put Payne's bullet-pierced heart in the right place--he's really just a good guy with an iron-clad exterior. The young recruits strut their stuff in the final round of their cadet competition (their marching rap is good for a solid laugh), and director Nick Castle keeps it all from becoming too stupid or over the top. It's arguably only for Wayans's most ardent fans, but as a send-up of all the great movie drill instructors, Major Payne is painlessly enjoyable. --Jeff Shannon \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Great quality-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I really enjoy action-packed movies with great fight sequences and thrilling chase scenes, so I'm looking for something that will keep me on the edge of my seat like the previous ones.

It is a great show though. I MUST EXPRESS THIS IN CAPS BECAUSE IT BOTHERED ME SO MUCH I ALMOST COULDN'T WATCH...  THE GIRL THAT PLAYED ANNE BOLEYN WAS NOT AT ALL RIGHT FOR THE PART...

It's awesome the way they have the actual people involved telling their stories, and not just some random narrator. It's makes it seem more real and really grabs your attention and holds it throughout the entire show. It never gets boring like so many shows of this genre do. I definitely recommend it, or at least, just check it out!!-------\nItem title: The Tudors \n Item description: Twenty seven years into his reign, Henry VIII is at the height of his powers. Not long after the execution of Anne Boleyn he takes a third wife -- Jane Seymour.  Soon there is wonderful news for King Henry: after some months of nervous waiting, his beloved Jane is expecting a child. Henry is convinced it will be his long-awaited male heir; when he is proven right, the country goes into a convulsion of celebration.  Soon after delivering the child, Jane falls into a fever and dies. Henry is heartbroken and becomes a recluse.  Cromwell however, encourages him remarry as soon as possible to the dowdy sister of the Duke of Cleves, Anne.  They marry in underwhelming circumstances and the marriage remains unconsummated, despite Henry's best efforts.  Ultimately, the failed marriage reflects badly on Cromwell and his enemies. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This is one of my favorite shows right now. The first two seasons were the best, with this one following them very closely. I have found that King Henry has gotten more and more angry with time. He has a darkness surrounding him, a coldness that has developed as a result of everything he's been through, especially all that happened with Anne Boleyn. The first two seasons showed him as happier and more carefree and understanding, but with time he has become so angry and cold. He has an almost blackness surrounding him and it's shows on his face, especially in his eyes. He has become so hardened to the world around him. He is now so quick to anger and doesn't think twice about violence against people, especially the ruthless killing which has gotten worse with every episode, being magnified in it's brutality and horror by Thomas Cromwell, an almost devilish person, who only cares about himself and his needs and wants. I really look forward to seeing where the story goes with each new episode. I definitely recommend this to all.-------\nItem title: Hall Pass (2011) \n Item description: Wedding Crashers' Owen Wilson and Going the Distance's Jason Sudeikisstar as best friends who have both been married for a long time. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This movie is so true to life,  how we all have been through different situations like this in our lives. and the different ways we have reacted...

It's one of those shows that pulls you in and you become addicted to it!! I love watching stuff that's based on true stories and events! The main character, Mary Sibley, played by Janet Montgomery, is absolutely brilliant. She is a phenomenal actress!!<br />The one negative thing about the show is Mercy... She does not fit in it and is annoying to watch. I think if they replaced her for someone more talented and better looking, it would add a lot more to it. But, this is definitely one of the best shows on t.v. right now. I definitely think everyone will love it, especially people who enjoy stuff having to do with witches, voodoo, darkness, and all that comes with it!! THE SET AND CAMERA WORK IS AWESOME!!

This show is fun and entertaining, even if it does revolve around high schoolers and petty drama. Sadie is one of my favorite characters, the quintessential rich, mean girl of the high school. Every character brings different things to the table, all of which are hilarious and so entertaining.  I'm in my thirties, and should be way above these kind of shows, but I absolutely LOVE THIS SHOW, and I'm always so excited for the next season.

DISGUSTING-------\nItem title: The Tudors \n Item description: THE TUDORS will present the rarely dramatized, tumultuous early years of King Henry VIII's nearly 40-year, omnipotent reign (1509-1547) of England. In addition to his famous female consorts and 20+ year marriage to Catherine of Aragon and the infamous dalliance with Anne Boleyn, the series delves into Henry's most notable political relationship and the deconstruction of the Roman Catholic Church in England. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This is a great show, but it doesn't give the feeling of the true medieval times, it looks and seems very cheaply made and does not look like they spent very much time giving it the look and feel of the times back then. It is a great show though. I MUST EXPRESS THIS IN CAPS BECAUSE IT BOTHERED ME SO MUCH I ALMOST COULDN'T WATCH...  THE GIRL THAT PLAYED ANNE BOLEYN WAS NOT AT ALL RIGHT FOR THE PART... SHE WAS VERY UNATTRACTIVE AND HER ACTING WAS SUB PAR AT BEST. IT TOOK AWAY FROM THE ENTIRE CAST AND THE ENTIRE SHOW.-------\nItem title: Evil Lives Here \n Item description: What if the person closest to you...were a devil in disguise? Would you see the signs? Evil Lives Here tells the true, heart-stopping stories of people who shared a home with a killer. In each case, they see suspicious signs that something is amiss. Eventually, they must come face to face with the horrible truth: that the person they loved, the person they trusted, is a monster. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: I love this show!! It's awesome the way they have the actual people involved telling their stories, and not just some random narrator. It's makes it seem more real and really grabs your attention and holds it throughout the entire show. It never gets boring like so many shows of this genre do. I definitely recommend it, or at least, just check it out!!-------\nItem title: The Tudors \n Item description: Twenty seven years into his reign, Henry VIII is at the height of his powers. Not long after the execution of Anne Boleyn he takes a third wife -- Jane Seymour.  Soon there is wonderful news for King Henry: after some months of nervous waiting, his beloved Jane is expecting a child. Henry is convinced it will be his long-awaited male heir; when he is proven right, the country goes into a convulsion of celebration.  Soon after delivering the child, Jane falls into a fever and dies. Henry is heartbroken and becomes a recluse.  Cromwell however, encourages him remarry as soon as possible to the dowdy sister of the Duke of Cleves, Anne.  They marry in underwhelming circumstances and the marriage remains unconsummated, despite Henry's best efforts.  Ultimately, the failed marriage reflects badly on Cromwell and his enemies. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: This is one of my favorite shows right now. The first two seasons were the best, with this one following them very closely. I have found that King Henry has gotten more and more angry with time. He has a darkness surrounding him, a coldness that has developed as a result of everything he's been through, especially all that happened with Anne Boleyn. The first two seasons showed him as happier and more carefree and understanding, but with time he has become so angry and cold. He has an almost blackness surrounding him and it's shows on his face, especially in his eyes. He has become so hardened to the world around him. He is now so quick to anger and doesn't think twice about violence against people, especially the ruthless killing which has gotten worse with every episode, being magnified in it's brutality and horror by Thomas Cromwell, an almost devilish person, who only cares about himself and his needs and wants. I really look forward to seeing where the story goes with each new episode. I definitely recommend this to all.-------\nItem title: Hall Pass (2011) \n Item description: Wedding Crashers' Owen Wilson and Going the Distance's Jason Sudeikisstar as best friends who have both been married for a long time. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This movie is so true to life,  how we all have been through different situations like this in our lives. and the different ways we have reacted... It's one of the funniest movie's I've ever seen \ud83d\ude1d-------\nItem title: Dixie's Diner [VHS] \n Item description: Frisky Loveable and talented Rock N Rolling Kids \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Love this!! I loved this as a kid and will always love it!! Many memories from my childhood. So happy this show is still around to purchase. Love you, Dixie and friends!!-------\nItem title: Salem \n Item description: Salem is set in the volatile world of 17th century Massachusetts and explores what really fueled the town's infamous witch trials and dares to uncover the dark, supernatural truth hiding behind the veil of this infamous period in American history. \n rating: 4.0 \n review: A great show!! It's one of those shows that pulls you in and you become addicted to it!! I love watching stuff that's based on true stories and events! The main character, Mary Sibley, played by Janet Montgomery, is absolutely brilliant. She is a phenomenal actress!!<br />The one negative thing about the show is Mercy... She does not fit in it and is annoying to watch. I think if they replaced her for someone more talented and better looking, it would add a lot more to it. But, this is definitely one of the best shows on t.v. right now. I definitely think everyone will love it, especially people who enjoy stuff having to do with witches, voodoo, darkness, and all that comes with it!! THE SET AND CAMERA WORK IS AWESOME!! I hope there is many more seasons to come!!!-------\nItem title: The Mighty B!: We Got the Bee \n Item description: Ten year old Bessie Higgenbottom is the world's most ambitious Honeybee scout. As a member of the Honeybees, Bessie wears her uniform every day, leads her troop with heart and determination and has earned more Bee badges than any Honeybee in history, but there are still a few badges that elude her and she's not stopping until she earns every last one of them! When Bessie needs inspiration, she imagines she's the Mighty B, a brave (and buff) superhero who can accomplish anything. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CARTOONS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I AM 32  YEARS OLD, AND I CRACK UP EVERY TIME I WATCH IT. I LOVE BESSY HIGGENBOTTUM (THE MAIN CHARACTER. SHE HAS THAT ADORABLE LISP AND SHE IS REALLY CUTE. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.-------\nItem title: Zombie Hood \n Item description: Zombie Hood begins on the eve of a worldwide zombie outbreak with a small group of survivors escaping the city. With food being in short supply, the survivors must risk visiting populated areas in an effort to stave off starvation. \n rating: 1.0 \n review: WTF did I just watch... for like, 2 seconds... that's all it took to realize that this was one of the worst movies' I've ever seen. Actually, it wasn't even close to be being a movie... it was like a horrible home video, that was shot by a 5 yar old. AWFUL!!!!-------\nItem title: The Duchess \n Item description: Chronicles the life of 18th century aristrocrat Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, an ancestor of Princess Di. \n rating: 3.0 \n review: What a horrible way to live, it is so extremely sad and depressing. The Duke must have been such an evil bastard. I wanted to go through the screen and choke him to death. I feel so bad for G, what a horrible existence.-------\nItem title: Awkward. \n Item description: In Season Four of \"Awkward,\" Jenna and her friends embark on their senior year-- an intense time fraught with anxiety about making the transition from dependent adolescent to independent adult. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: HILARIOUS!! This show is fun and entertaining, even if it does revolve around high schoolers and petty drama. Sadie is one of my favorite characters, the quintessential rich, mean girl of the high school. Every character brings different things to the table, all of which are hilarious and so entertaining.  I'm in my thirties, and should be way above these kind of shows, but I absolutely LOVE THIS SHOW, and I'm always so excited for the next season. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE, BUT THIS IS NOT A SHOW FOR CHILDREN, AT ALL!! HOPE THERE ARE MANY MORE SEASONS TO COME!!-------\nItem title: Hoops & Yoyo Ruin Christmas \n Item description: Hoops and Yoyo wait up to see Santa;and inadvertently end up in his sleigh;traveling with him through the time-space continuum that allows Santa to visit everyone in the world in one night. When they fall off the sleigh part-way through the continuum;they find themselves back in time with a young Kris Kringle;who has not yet become the magical toy-giver we know of today. Their arrival back in time disrupts the natural order of events that will make Kris Kringle;Santa;forcing the duo into a desperate race to set things right so that the world will have its Santa Claus. \n rating: 5.0 \n review: HOOPS AND YOYO ARE THE FUNNIEST LITTLE GUYS, THEY ALWAYS CRACK ME UP AND MAKE ME FEEL BETTER... I LOVE THESE CUTIES!!-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey there!

Inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham, modern master of the English village mystery, the series stars John Nettles ( Bergerac ) as the unflappable Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. Daniel Casey ( The Wingless Bird )) costars as Barnaby\u0092s earnest young assistant, Sergeant Troy. When Troy wins a promotion and transfer, Barnaby gets a partner of a different stripe. Sergeant Dan Scott (John Hopkins, Love in a Cold Climate )) is a streetwise Londoner who mistakenly expects an easy, dull life on the rural beat. Guest stars include Cherie Lunghi, John Standing, Michael Simkins, Henry Ian Cusick, Diana Kent, and Stella Gonet. The Mysteries The Green Man -- Troy passes his inspector's exam and is moving on, but not before one more challenging case with Barnaby in Midsomer Worthy Bad Tidings -- Dan Scott, Barnaby's new partner, gets a baptism by fire with a case in Midsomer Mallow that implicates Cullly and her old schoolmates. The Fisher King -- Barnaby and Scott follow a maze of Celtic rites, ancient artifacts, and twisted relationships to find the murderer of a Midsomer Barrow landowner. Sins of Commission -- Murder attends the annual literary festival in Midsomer St. Michael, leading Barnaby and Scott to discover a hotbed of corruption within the highbrow crowd. Amazon.com Midsomer Murders: Set Seven includes four intriguing episodes from season seven of the long-running, British mystery series, based on a series of books by Caroline Graham. Fans of Midsomer Murders will certainly take note of a big change in the crime drama, as Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) of the Causton C.I.D. loses his longtime junior partner, Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) to the latter's promotion and relocation. Still, Troy is around for \"The Green Man,\" Barnaby's attempt to crack a case of multiple murders in quaint Midsomer, a supposedly quiet English village in which passions flair and blood flows with astonishing regularity. \"The Green Man\" concerns a pair of overlapping investigations with an environmental theme. When an effort to restore a stream uncovers the remains of several people who died in a long-ago, tunnel cave-in, Barnaby discovers that one of the apparent victims was actually placed on the site much later. Meanwhile, adolescent hoodlums harassing an indigent woodsman are turning up dead. \"Bad Tidings\" introduces Barnaby's new partner, Detective Sergeant Dan Scott (John Hopkins), unhappy about his transfer from London and reluctant to settle in. But he pulls his weight assisting Barnaby on a strange case that begins with the murder of a woman walking home from a flamenco-themed party at the Midsomer Mallow village hall. (A recurring theme in Midsomer Murders of hatred and deception running rampant among trustees of Midsomer\u0092s social and cultural life plays a big part here.) \"The Fisher King\" resurrects an old, unsolved mystery concerning the death of a man who excavated ancient artifacts, while Barnaby and Scott also try to find out who killed an arrogant millionaire with a wound similar to the one suffered by the titular, Arthurian figure. Finally, \"Sins of Commission\" is a wild episode peeling back secrecy surrounding sexual and fiduciary scandals surrounding a literary festival. Adding both to the drama and fun is the way Barnaby's wife (Jane Wymark) and daughter (Laura Howard) have a way of getting involved with every investigation. With a likable, low-key hero and creative new forms of Midsomer malice, Set Seven is a winner. --Tom Keogh \n rating: 5.0 \n review: These were all great shows, but Papa ordered ones we already had, so it was a little disappointing.  Again, the shows are just great.  Thanks, Gwen-------\nItem title: SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS \n Item description: Product Description In his novel A Study in Scarlet, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced a group of six street urchins called the Baker Street Irregulars. The Irregulars return in this original mystery produced for the BBC starring Jonathan Pryce, Bill Patterson, Anna Chancellor, and Michael Maloney. A gripping family drama, it has everything Holmes fans expect: complex characters, a compelling story, a brilliant villain, and a satisfying solution. The witty script gives Holmes a slightly more modern feel that will appeal to a new generation of viewers. Amazon.com The Baker Street Irregulars, London street urchins who provided reconnaissance for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, have long been ripe for an adventure of their own. British television movie Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars fills the bill pretty well, with an original story that finds an old enemy of Holmes masterminding the destruction of the sleuth as well as his young allies. When the disappearance of one Irregular happens to coincide with a bizarre plot to murder Scotland Yard inspectors, not even Holmes (Jonathan Pryce) sees a connection until it's too late. By then, two kids are missing and suspicion falls on Holmes himself for the cop killings, forcing him to entrust his fate--and that of the others--to the children who work tirelessly for him. The mystery and drama are satisfying, though Doyle purists will balk at the film's liberties with Holmes' personal and professional history. The story, however, really has more to do with redefining the Irregulars as a kind of family unto themselves, poor kids who have no one without one another, and no purpose without their occasional marching orders from a man they very much admire. This is a family movie that can be enjoyed even by those who've never heard of Sherlock Holmes, though a passing familiarity helps. With Bill Paterson as Dr. Watson and Michael Maloney as a typically obtuse inspector. --Tom Keogh Review A crackling good Sherlock Holmes yarn. -- The Hollywood Reporter Very Good - charming British film. -- San Francisco Chronicle, September 2007 See more \n rating: 5.0 \n review: It's a nice switch from just the straight Sherlock Holmes, we enjoy the shows.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: I'm a big fan of mystery and crime dramas, always looking for new ones to watch.

Fans of Midsomer Murders will certainly take note of a big change in the crime drama, as Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) of the Causton C.I.D. loses his longtime junior partner, Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) to the latter's promotion and relocation. Still, Troy is around for \"The Green Man,\" Barnaby's attempt to crack a case of multiple murders in quaint Midsomer, a supposedly quiet English village in which passions flair and blood flows with astonishing regularity. \"The Green Man\" concerns a pair of overlapping investigations with an environmental theme. When an effort to restore a stream uncovers the remains of several people who died in a long-ago, tunnel cave-in, Barnaby discovers that one of the apparent victims was actually placed on the site much later. Meanwhile, adolescent hoodlums harassing an indigent woodsman are turning up dead. \"Bad Tidings\" introduces Barnaby's new partner, Detective Sergeant Dan Scott (John Hopkins), unhappy about his transfer from London and reluctant to settle in. But he pulls his weight assisting Barnaby on a strange case that begins with the murder of a woman walking home from a flamenco-themed party at the Midsomer Mallow village hall. (A recurring theme in Midsomer Murders of hatred and deception running rampant among trustees of Midsomer\u0092s social and cultural life plays a big part here.) \"The Fisher King\" resurrects an old, unsolved mystery concerning the death of a man who excavated ancient artifacts, while Barnaby and Scott also try to find out who killed an arrogant millionaire with a wound similar to the one suffered by the titular, Arthurian figure. Finally, \"Sins of Commission\" is a wild episode peeling back secrecy surrounding sexual and fiduciary scandals surrounding a literary festival. Adding both to the drama and fun is the way Barnaby's wife (Jane Wymark) and daughter (Laura Howard) have a way of getting involved with every investigation. With a likable, low-key hero and creative new forms of Midsomer malice, Set Seven is a winner. --Tom Keogh  rating: 5.0  review: These were all great shows, but Papa ordered ones we already had, so it was a little disappointing.  Again, the shows are just great.  Thanks, Gwen-------Item title: SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS  Item description: Product Description In his novel A Study in Scarlet, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced a group of six street urchins called the Baker Street Irregulars. The Irregulars return in this original mystery produced for the BBC starring Jonathan Pryce, Bill Patterson, Anna Chancellor, and Michael Maloney. A gripping family drama, it has everything Holmes fans expect: complex characters, a compelling story, a brilliant villain, and a satisfying solution. The witty script gives Holmes a slightly more modern feel that will appeal to a new generation of viewers. Amazon.com The Baker Street Irregulars, London street urchins who provided reconnaissance for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, have long been ripe for an adventure of their own. British television movie Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars fills the bill pretty well, with an original story that finds an old enemy of Holmes masterminding the destruction of the sleuth as well as his young allies. When the disappearance of one Irregular happens to coincide with a bizarre plot to murder Scotland Yard inspectors, not even Holmes (Jonathan Pryce) sees a connection until it's too late. By then, two kids are missing and suspicion falls on Holmes himself for the cop killings, forcing him to entrust his fate--and that of the others--to the children who work tirelessly for him. The mystery and drama are satisfying, though Doyle purists will balk at the film's liberties with Holmes' personal and professional history. The story, however, really has more to do with redefining the Irregulars as a kind of family unto themselves, poor kids who have no one without one another, and no purpose without their occasional marching orders from a man they very much admire. This is a family movie that can be enjoyed even by those who've never heard of Sherlock Holmes, though a passing familiarity helps. With Bill Paterson as Dr. Watson and Michael Maloney as a typically obtuse inspector. --Tom Keogh Review A crackling good Sherlock Holmes yarn. -- The Hollywood Reporter Very Good - charming British film. -- San Francisco Chronicle, September 2007 See more  rating: 5.0  review: It's a nice switch from just the straight Sherlock Holmes, we enjoy the shows.-------```And here is the user's intention: I'm a big fan of mystery and crime dramas, always looking for new ones to watch.

        "ground_truth": "Title: Midsomer Murders: Set Eight (The Maid in Splendour / The Straw Woman / Ghosts of Christmas Past) \n Description: Product Description What evil lurks beyond the well-trimmed hedges of Midsomer... The cozy villages of Midsomer County reveal their most sinister secrets in these contemporary British television mysteries. Inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham, modern master of the English village mystery, the series stars John Nettles ( Bergerac ) as the unflappable Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby with John Hopkins ( Love in a Cold Climate ) as his brash young assistant. Guest stars include John Burgess, William Gaunt, Freddie Jones, Keith Barron, and Margery Mason. The Mysteries The Maid in Splendour \u0097Midsomer Worthy\u0092s beloved local pub figures in a case involving unrequited love, secret business deals, and passionate affairs. The Straw Woman \u0097Scott becomes bewitched by a village schoolteacher as he and Barnaby unravel a centuries-old mystery in Midsomer Parva. Ghosts of Christmas Past \u0097Barnaby escapes Christmas with his in-laws only to be thrust into the shadowy world and dark secrets of the mysterious Villiers family. DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE John Nettles interview, Midsomer map, Caroline Graham biography, and cast filmographies. Amazon.com Idyllic Midsomer county has an alarmingly high mortality rate--at least on television. As actor John Nettles comments in a charming interview, after several series of the murder mystery program Midsomer Murders only a handful of villagers would be left alive. The show's writers tried to lower the body count to a more plausible number, but viewers complained, so Midsomer is as lethal as ever. Set Eight , featuring three episodes from Midsomer Murders ' seventh series, racks up its share of corpses as the ever-observant DCI Barnaby (Nettles) and his brash right hand man Dan Scott (John Hopkins) sort through a tale of unrequited love and secret real estate deals that mirrors an old legend, a collision of the church and pagan ways that sparks several flaming deaths, and a Christmas gathering that turns murderous as the truth about a long-ago suicide comes out. Midsomer Murders is topnotch: The 90-100 minute episode length allows each episode to unfold intricate plots while cultivating a distinct atmosphere and establishing vivid characters. Anchoring it all is Nettles, whose combination of gravitas and sly wit make him not only an excellent detective but a delightful and engaging personality. Hopkins is less charismatic, but he provides a suitable foil for his senior colleague. Aside from the interview with Nettles, the extras are modest: A map of the county, a handful of cast filmographies, and a slender bit of biography about Caroline Graham, the mystery novelist who created DCI Barnaby and his rural miasma of passion, jealousy, and bitter revenge. --Bret Fetzer Review If great acting, great storytelling, and gripping drama is what you want, Midsomer Murders: Set Eight provides it all. -- Movie Web Recommended - a welcome respite from the flash and noise of detective shows on tv today. -- DVD Talk, March 6, 2007 4 Stars - Nettles combination of gravitas and sly wit make him an excellent detective and a delightful and engaging personality. -- Tulsa Review See more",

Brilliantly imaginative. Endlessly thrilling. Pick your term. The mystery of the universes deepens in the critically acclaimed 22-episode third season of television\u2019s most exciting sci-fi. The Fringe team escapes from the parallel universe \u2013 except for Olivia, trapped in the other world and replaced in ours by her double, who turns Peter and Olivia\u2019s tentative relationship into a love affair. Then Olivia returns, bonds of trust fray, ever more bizarre and terrifying phenomena occur and secrets that stretch back to 1985 threaten to destroy our universe. Or theirs. Amazon.com What might be television's smartest and most intriguing science-fiction series pushes forward with 22 episodes (on six discs, including bonus material) comprising the third season of Fringe . The first season of this Fox show introduced us to the members of the Fringe Division (an obscure wing of the FBI assigned to investigate all manner of supernatural phenomena), and the principal characters, Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), mad scientist Walter Bishop (John Noble), and Bishop's son Peter (Joshua Jackson). In season two, we learned of the existence of a parallel universe, and that Peter is not Walter's real son, but rather his doppelg\u00e4nger, whom Walter kidnapped when his own, \"prime universe\" son died. This two-universe paradigm now takes center stage--in fact, for the first third of the season, odd-numbered episodes take place in the parallel universe, with even-numbered ones set in \"our world\" (the remaining episodes are mostly, but not exclusively, in the latter). The two universes are substantially similar, notwithstanding some quirky differences, with everyone having a counterpart in the opposite world. Olivia, referred to as \"Fauxlivia,\" spends multiple episodes in the prime universe; meanwhile, in the parallel universe, Walter's far less benign opposite number (\"Walternate,\" Peter's real father) is the secretary of defense, who schemes to get his son back and annihilate the prime universe in the process. Thus Walter's kidnapping gambit 25 years earlier caused an off-balance chain reaction that threatens both worlds, while Peter, the only one who has no doppelg\u00e4nger, becomes the linchpin, sort of the Harry Potter of the series; not only is he alone capable of operating Walternate's \"doomsday machine,\" but he's also unique in believing that the two universes can coexist, instead of wiping each other out. Portions of Fringe take place in the past as well as the future, a fact that, when added to the ping-ponging between the two universes, can make the series somewhat confusing and a bit tedious, especially for newcomers. Fortunately, the weird science that made earlier seasons so enjoyable is still around. There's an \"ultrasonic music box\" that kills anyone who opens it, a strange blue powder that melts the bones of anyone who inhales it, beetles that eat people from the inside out, a \"molecular destabilizer,\" and a \"negative matter ring.\" Various episodes feature a nut who tries to reanimate his girlfriend by retrieving her harvested organs from those who received them when she died, shapeshifters who bleed mercury, a poor fellow who can't stop reading other people's minds, William Bell (Leonard Nimoy), Walter's old partner and friend, who at one point occupies Olivia's mind\u2026 and Walter's not-infrequent consumption of LSD. Trippy? You bet. But Fringe , with bonus features including multiple featurettes, a couple of audio commentaries, and other bells and whistles, is well worth the investment. --Sam Graham \n rating: 5.0 \n review: I used to like The X-Files very much. Fringe is ten times better. More interesting characters, Stories, Special effects, and more. There are great puzzles in the story lines that, unlike The X-files, are answered down the road. The level of mystery is excellent and the characters are very likeable. The unpredictability of the show is another bonus. I hope this show goes on for years and years and hopefully they will keep the same level of writing skill.-------\nItem title: Pokemon - Destiny Deoxys [DVD] \n Item description: Leap into an amazing all-new action-packed movie and meet the mysterious Deoxys(TM) as this exciting Pok mon adventure takes you beyond your wildest imagination.

With the help of his slacker roommate Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun fights his way across town to rescue Liz, but the petty concerns of life keep getting in the way: When they're trying to use vinyl records to decapitate a pair of zombies, Shaun and Ed bicker about which bands deserve preservation--New Order they keep, but Sade becomes a lethal frisbee. Many zombie movies are comedies by accident, but Shaun of the Dead is deliberately and brilliantly funny, while still delivering a few delicious jolts of fear. Also featuring the stealthy comic presence of Bill Nighy ( Love Actually ) and some familar faces from The Office . --Bret Fetzer \n rating: 2.0 \n review: Let me state the good before the one bad thing. It's a good movie. It's very funny and very well acted. Very well done, directing and writing. It's an all around good movie. The one bad thing is the usage of the \"F\" word. I mean Wow! It's as if the writer of the movie was granted a wish by a Genie for every time he put the \"F\" word in the script. There was one scene where I had to mute it and wait for the scene to end before turning the sound back on. I would give this movie five stars. They were lucky I gave it two.-------\nItem title: SPACE 1999 Season 2 \n Item description:  \n rating: 5.0 \n review: Just like the first season. It's a great classic. Sit back on a weekend and watch an episode or two. This show was done when good stories were the main goal. The special effects are cheesy but it's still cool old television. Glad I got it.-------\nItem title: Red Barry \n Item description: First time on DVD! Based on the comic strip by Will Gould, the serial followed the adventures of tough guy police detective \"Red\" Barry (Crabbe) in his quest to recover valuable stolen savings bonds. Crabbe has to deal with a gang of Russian crooks (headed by Edna Sedgewick and including Stanley Price), a group of Chinese agents (headed by Cyril Delevanti) and a bunch of American/Chinese racketeers (headed by Frank Lackteen, Wheeler Oakman and a young Tom Steele), as well as a hostile police commissioner (William Gould; no relation to the strip's creator) and a bumbling British sleuth named Valentine Vane (Hugh Huntley). Despite all the conflicting gangs, Crabbe manages to come out on top with the help of female reporter Mississippi (Frances Robinson) and Police Inspector \"Scotty\" Scott (Wade Boteler). Crabbe was ideal as Barry, an unshakable and unconventional cop who didn't let protocol or \"due process\" mess up his investigations, and who was in constant conflict with the windbag police commissioner (William Gould). \n rating: 5.0 \n review: For me Buster Crabbe is just plain cool. This serial is evidence of that. It's action oriented and just plain fun. It's hard to watch just one episode. This is not academy award winning stuff but like I said it was made for fun entertainment. The cliff-hangers are crazy at times but they do keep you going to the next episode to find out what happens. Best of all. I love Fedora hats and this serial is full of them (Icing on the cake). This serial was made in 1938. So there are also lots of cool old cars as well.-------\nItem title: SPACE 1999 Season 1 \n Item description:  \n rating: 5.0 \n review: This show is a classic. Not just in general terms either. It has originality, good stories.

All six seasons of coolness. Great classic and a geat price to. Pure, fun entertainment. The older I get the more I turn to movies and tv from the past. No cussing, NO sex, NO modern day gutter minded trash. Just well done, fun. Not only that but it has other elements I love. Lots of Fedora hats and those really cool old cars.

I have been a watcher of the other show \"Ghost Hunters\" with Jason and Grant for a few years. Ghost Hunters is fairly blan in recent seasons. \"Ghost Adventures\" on the other hand is very energetic and to the point. Zak, Aaron, and Nick are serious about what they do. I mean they intend to find something when they go ghost hunting. They also have a good sense of humor at times and make it fun to watch their show. They really make you wish you could go ghost hunting with them. I intend to buy the other seasons as well. Highly recomended.-------\n```\nAnd here is the user's intention: Hey, recommend me this movie, it sounds like a fun and entertaining watch!\nPlease infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Brilliantly imaginative. Endlessly thrilling. Pick your term. The mystery of the universes deepens in the critically acclaimed 22-episode third season of television\u2019s most exciting sci-fi. The Fringe team escapes from the parallel universe \u2013 except for Olivia, trapped in the other world and replaced in ours by her double, who turns Peter and Olivia\u2019s tentative relationship into a love affair. Then Olivia returns, bonds of trust fray, ever more bizarre and terrifying phenomena occur and secrets that stretch back to 1985 threaten to destroy our universe. Or theirs. Amazon.com What might be television's smartest and most intriguing science-fiction series pushes forward with 22 episodes (on six discs, including bonus material) comprising the third season of Fringe . The first season of this Fox show introduced us to the members of the Fringe Division (an obscure wing of the FBI assigned to investigate all manner of supernatural phenomena), and the principal characters, Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), mad scientist Walter Bishop (John Noble), and Bishop's son Peter (Joshua Jackson). In season two, we learned of the existence of a parallel universe, and that Peter is not Walter's real son, but rather his doppelg\u00e4nger, whom Walter kidnapped when his own, \"prime universe\" son died. This two-universe paradigm now takes center stage--in fact, for the first third of the season, odd-numbered episodes take place in the parallel universe, with even-numbered ones set in \"our world\" (the remaining episodes are mostly, but not exclusively, in the latter). The two universes are substantially similar, notwithstanding some quirky differences, with everyone having a counterpart in the opposite world. Olivia, referred to as \"Fauxlivia,\" spends multiple episodes in the prime universe; meanwhile, in the parallel universe, Walter's far less benign opposite number (\"Walternate,\" Peter's real father) is the secretary of defense, who schemes to get his son back and annihilate the prime universe in the process. Thus Walter's kidnapping gambit 25 years earlier caused an off-balance chain reaction that threatens both worlds, while Peter, the only one who has no doppelg\u00e4nger, becomes the linchpin, sort of the Harry Potter of the series; not only is he alone capable of operating Walternate's \"doomsday machine,\" but he's also unique in believing that the two universes can coexist, instead of wiping each other out. Portions of Fringe take place in the past as well as the future, a fact that, when added to the ping-ponging between the two universes, can make the series somewhat confusing and a bit tedious, especially for newcomers. Fortunately, the weird science that made earlier seasons so enjoyable is still around. There's an \"ultrasonic music box\" that kills anyone who opens it, a strange blue powder that melts the bones of anyone who inhales it, beetles that eat people from the inside out, a \"molecular destabilizer,\" and a \"negative matter ring.\" Various episodes feature a nut who tries to reanimate his girlfriend by retrieving her harvested organs from those who received them when she died, shapeshifters who bleed mercury, a poor fellow who can't stop reading other people's minds, William Bell (Leonard Nimoy), Walter's old partner and friend, who at one point occupies Olivia's mind\u2026 and Walter's not-infrequent consumption of LSD. Trippy? You bet. But Fringe , with bonus features including multiple featurettes, a couple of audio commentaries, and other bells and whistles, is well worth the investment. --Sam Graham  rating: 5.0  review: I used to like The X-Files very much. Fringe is ten times better. More interesting characters, Stories, Special effects, and more. There are great puzzles in the story lines that, unlike The X-files, are answered down the road. The level of mystery is excellent and the characters are very likeable. The unpredictability of the show is another bonus. I hope this show goes on for years and years and hopefully they will keep the same level of writing skill.-------Item title: Pokemon - Destiny Deoxys [DVD]  Item description: Leap into an amazing all-new action-packed movie and meet the mysterious Deoxys(TM) as this exciting Pok mon adventure takes you beyond your wildest imagination. Four years ago a strange meteorite crashed to earth carrying a powerful secret. Now journey to high-tech Larousse City where secrets are revealed as Ash, Pikachu, and the gang meet Tory -- a new friend who is afraid of Pok mon and their trainers. New fears surface when a mysterious aurora appears over the city along with Deoxys -- a Pok mon unlike any seen before. When a spectacular battle between Deoxys and Rayquaza begins, more than just Ash and Pikachu will be needed to stop it. It will take everyone! Charged with big surprises, nonstop action, and heroic adventure, POKEMON: DESTINY DEOXYS is packed with out-of-this-world thrills!  rating: 5.0  review: My daughter loves Pokemon and so do I. This movie is great because it introduces a new character and has a great story. The animation is cool as usual with the Pokemon movies. Deoxys is really cool. I wish they made more movies with that character but there are so many others. Ultimately, if you like Pokemon. You can't go wrong by picking up this one. It's a keeper.-------Item title: Shaun of the Dead  Item description: Amazon.com British horror/comedy Shaun of the Dead is a scream in all senses of the word. Brain-hungry zombies shamble through the streets of London, but all unambitious electronics salesman Shaun (Simon Pegg) cares about is his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), who just dumped him. With the help of his slacker roommate Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun fights his way across town to rescue Liz, but the petty concerns of life keep getting in the way: When they're trying to use vinyl records to decapitate a pair of zombies, Shaun and Ed bicker about which bands deserve preservation--New Order they keep, but Sade becomes a lethal frisbee. Many zombie movies are comedies by accident, but Shaun of the Dead is deliberately and brilliantly funny, while still delivering a few delicious jolts of fear. Also featuring the stealthy comic presence of Bill Nighy ( Love Actually ) and some familar faces from The Office . --Bret Fetzer  rating: 2.0  review: Let me state the good before the one bad thing. It's a good movie. It's very funny and very well acted. Very well done, directing and writing. It's an all around good movie. The one bad thing is the usage of the \"F\" word. I mean Wow! It's as if the writer of the movie was granted a wish by a Genie for every time he put the \"F\" word in the script. There was one scene where I had to mute it and wait for the scene to end before turning the sound back on. I would give this movie five stars. They were lucky I gave it two.-------Item title: SPACE 1999 Season 2  Item description:   rating: 5.0  review: Just like the first season. It's a great classic. Sit back on a weekend and watch an episode or two. This show was done when good stories were the main goal. The special effects are cheesy but it's still cool old television. Glad I got it.-------Item title: Red Barry  Item description: First time on DVD! Based on the comic strip by Will Gould, the serial followed the adventures of tough guy police detective \"Red\" Barry (Crabbe) in his quest to recover valuable stolen savings bonds. Crabbe has to deal with a gang of Russian crooks (headed by Edna Sedgewick and including Stanley Price), a group of Chinese agents (headed by Cyril Delevanti) and a bunch of American/Chinese racketeers (headed by Frank Lackteen, Wheeler Oakman and a young Tom Steele), as well as a hostile police commissioner (William Gould; no relation to the strip's creator) and a bumbling British sleuth named Valentine Vane (Hugh Huntley). Despite all the conflicting gangs, Crabbe manages to come out on top with the help of female reporter Mississippi (Frances Robinson) and Police Inspector \"Scotty\" Scott (Wade Boteler). Crabbe was ideal as Barry, an unshakable and unconventional cop who didn't let protocol or \"due process\" mess up his investigations, and who was in constant conflict with the windbag police commissioner (William Gould).  rating: 5.0  review: For me Buster Crabbe is just plain cool. This serial is evidence of that. It's action oriented and just plain fun. It's hard to watch just one episode. This is not academy award winning stuff but like I said it was made for fun entertainment. The cliff-hangers are crazy at times but they do keep you going to the next episode to find out what happens. Best of all. I love Fedora hats and this serial is full of them (Icing on the cake). This serial was made in 1938. So there are also lots of cool old cars as well.-------Item title: SPACE 1999 Season 1  Item description:   rating: 5.0  review: This show is a classic. Not just in general terms either. It has originality, good stories. I am disappointed the show is only two seasons.-------Item title: Adventures of Superman: The Complete Collection  Item description: Adventures of Superman, Seasons 1-6 (DVD) (4-Pack) The legendary Man of Steele, last survivor of the doomed planet Krypton lives on earth, assuming the secret identity of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for the Metropolis Daily Planet. But with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men, he battles for truth and justice as Superman. ]]>  rating: 5.0  review: What can I say, other than Fantastic? All six seasons of coolness. Great classic and a geat price to. Pure, fun entertainment. The older I get the more I turn to movies and tv from the past. No cussing, NO sex, NO modern day gutter minded trash. Just well done, fun. Not only that but it has other elements I love. Lots of Fedora hats and those really cool old cars. A classic time in American history. Every episode is five stars to me.-------Item title: Ghost Adventures: Season 1  Item description: Afraid of the dark? Now find out why as paranormal investigator Zak Bagans and his crew, Nick Groff and Aaron Goodwin, travel from Idaho to Scotland, and anywhere in between, to scare up the most unearthly mysteries and ghost sightings imaginable. Their in-depth investigations take the team to notoriously haunted locales where they research the history of paranormal phenomena, interview eye-witnesses and then face off with the spirits themselves in this series that will chill your blood and make you want to sleep with the lights on. Moundsville Penitentiary - Moundsville, WV Bobby Mackey Music World - Wilder, KY Houghton Mansion - North Adams, MA Riddle House - West Palm Beach, FL Sloss Furnace - Birmingham, AL Former Psychiatric Hospital - Northern NJ Edinburgh Vaults - Edinburgh, Scotland The Old Idaho Penitentiary - Boise, ID  rating: 5.0  review: I stumbled across this show by accident. I have been a watcher of the other show \"Ghost Hunters\" with Jason and Grant for a few years. Ghost Hunters is fairly blan in recent seasons. \"Ghost Adventures\" on the other hand is very energetic and to the point. Zak, Aaron, and Nick are serious about what they do. I mean they intend to find something when they go ghost hunting. They also have a good sense of humor at times and make it fun to watch their show. They really make you wish you could go ghost hunting with them. I intend to buy the other seasons as well. Highly recomended.-------```And here is the user's intention: Hey, recommend me this movie, it sounds like a fun and entertaining watch!Please infer the user's preference based on historical purchases and reviews along with the user's intention, and then recommend an item for this user.

Amazon.com There are plenty of belly laughs in The Mel Brooks Collection , an eight-disc set of most of the director-writer-actor's best-known films. Four of them-- Silent Movie , High Anxiety , To Be or Not to Be , and Robin Hood: Men with Tights --are making their debut on DVD, while a fifth, The Twelve Chairs , was briefly available as a non-anamorphic DVD from Image Entertainment (all the DVDs in this set are anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs). That means you can sample a 23-year stretch of Brooks's outrageous and affectionate spoofing of everything from movies to popular legends to movies to historical figures to, hey! more movies. The earliest film, The Twelve Chairs (1970), is the least known, but is one of the funniest, helped greatly by a good story (adapted from a 1920s Russian tale) and the casting of Ron Moody and Frank Langella as treasure hunters. Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles followed in 1974. The former, a spoof of horror films, is easily one of the top two or three funniest movies of all time, and the latter is justly famous for its often-tasteless send-up of Western cliches. Silent Movie (1976) is just what the title describes, with its only word of dialogue spoken from the least-likely source, and High Anxiety (1977) pays tribute to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. History of the World, Part 1 (1981) mocks historical events and epics, and To Be or Not to Be (1983) is a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 classic of the same name (it's also the only film in the set for which Brooks didn't receive writing and directing credit). By this time, Brooks was more actively taking the leading roles himself (rather than the bit parts), and unfortunately relying less on his topnotch ensemble of recurring players, which included Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, and Dom DeLuise. But he does use a new ensemble (including Cary Elwes and, in his film debut, Dave Chappelle), for Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), the feature-length spin on the same hero Brooks had spoofed in his short-lived 1975 television series When Things Were Rotten . Bonus features are minor. In addition to an HBO featurette on Men in Tights , there's a featurette and interviews on To Be or Not to Be and all the features (Brooks commentary, deleted scenes, interviews, etc.) that were on the original release of Young Frankenstein . Note that while rights issues kept The Producers , Spaceballs , and other films out of this set, 20th Century Fox was able to use Warner Bros.' Blazing Saddles . The features on that disc, however, are the ones that were on the 1997 DVD release, not the 2004 anniversary reissue. Regardless, the set's price for this many films is low, and because it has so many films new to DVD, Brooks fans will want to pick this up faster than they can say... \" Frau Bl\u00fccher! \" --David Horiuchi \n rating: 5.0 \n review: this is the perfect collection for a Mel Brooks fan.

Like Ol' Man River, its delights just keep rollin' along. ANNIE GET YOUR GUN Betty Hutton (as Annie Oakley) and Howard Keel (as Frank Butler) star in this sharpshootin' funfest an Oscar winner for adaptation scoring based on the Broadway smash boasting Irving Berlins beloved songs, including Doin' What Comes Naturally, I Got Lost in His Arms and the anthemic There's No Business like Show Business. SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS The perfect marriage of song and dance! Backwoods boys inspired by romance and the lure of hot biscuits raid the local town for brides. Un-uh: The would-be brides insist the fellas first become respectable! Howard Keel and Jane Powell head a leaping whoop for joy in this exuberant Oscar winner. KISS ME KATE When squabbling ex-married's Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel are cast as squabbling Renaissance romantics in a musical The Taming of the Shrew, life imitates art, art imitates life and it all proves no musical comedy imitates this backstage/onstage delight from the Broadway hit with 14 peerless Cole Porter songs. It's all Too Darn Hot! ]]> Amazon.com Turner Classic Movies' Greatest Classic Films Collection: Broadway Musicals collects four movies on two double-sided discs, with top picture quality and the bonus features that appeared on disc 1 when one of those films was released on a two-disc set, or the features that appeared on the single discs of the other three. The four films here aren't really Broadway musicals, but rather movies that were (with one exception) based on material originally created for the Broadway stage. Show Boat was one of the earliest shows in the modern-musical era, and this 1951 adaptation (the third, following versions in 1929 and 1936) stars familiar MGM players Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and others in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Southern epic, featuring \"Ol' Man River,\" \"Can't Help Loving That Man of Mine,\" and more.

I like how this movie is not too overly chick-flicky-------Item title: The Mel Brooks Collection (Blazing Saddles / Young Frankenstein / Silent Movie / Robin Hood: Men in Tights / To Be or Not to Be / History of the World, Part 1 / The Twelve Chairs / High Anxiety)  Item description: Product Description INCLUDES: SILENT MOVIE, ROBIN HOOD-MEN IN TIGHTS, BLAZING SADDLES, HIGH ANXIETY, HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1, TO BE OR NOT TO BE, TWELVE CHAIRS, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Amazon.com There are plenty of belly laughs in The Mel Brooks Collection , an eight-disc set of most of the director-writer-actor's best-known films. Four of them-- Silent Movie , High Anxiety , To Be or Not to Be , and Robin Hood: Men with Tights --are making their debut on DVD, while a fifth, The Twelve Chairs , was briefly available as a non-anamorphic DVD from Image Entertainment (all the DVDs in this set are anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs). That means you can sample a 23-year stretch of Brooks's outrageous and affectionate spoofing of everything from movies to popular legends to movies to historical figures to, hey! more movies. The earliest film, The Twelve Chairs (1970), is the least known, but is one of the funniest, helped greatly by a good story (adapted from a 1920s Russian tale) and the casting of Ron Moody and Frank Langella as treasure hunters. Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles followed in 1974. The former, a spoof of horror films, is easily one of the top two or three funniest movies of all time, and the latter is justly famous for its often-tasteless send-up of Western cliches. Silent Movie (1976) is just what the title describes, with its only word of dialogue spoken from the least-likely source, and High Anxiety (1977) pays tribute to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. History of the World, Part 1 (1981) mocks historical events and epics, and To Be or Not to Be (1983) is a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 classic of the same name (it's also the only film in the set for which Brooks didn't receive writing and directing credit). By this time, Brooks was more actively taking the leading roles himself (rather than the bit parts), and unfortunately relying less on his topnotch ensemble of recurring players, which included Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, and Dom DeLuise. But he does use a new ensemble (including Cary Elwes and, in his film debut, Dave Chappelle), for Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), the feature-length spin on the same hero Brooks had spoofed in his short-lived 1975 television series When Things Were Rotten . Bonus features are minor. In addition to an HBO featurette on Men in Tights , there's a featurette and interviews on To Be or Not to Be and all the features (Brooks commentary, deleted scenes, interviews, etc.) that were on the original release of Young Frankenstein . Note that while rights issues kept The Producers , Spaceballs , and other films out of this set, 20th Century Fox was able to use Warner Bros.' Blazing Saddles . The features on that disc, however, are the ones that were on the 1997 DVD release, not the 2004 anniversary reissue. Regardless, the set's price for this many films is low, and because it has so many films new to DVD, Brooks fans will want to pick this up faster than they can say... \" Frau Bl\u00fccher! \" --David Horiuchi  rating: 5.0  review: this is the perfect collection for a Mel Brooks fan. Bought it as a Christmas present for my brother.

KISS ME KATE When squabbling ex-married's Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel are cast as squabbling Renaissance romantics in a musical The Taming of the Shrew, life imitates art, art imitates life and it all proves no musical comedy imitates this backstage/onstage delight from the Broadway hit with 14 peerless Cole Porter songs.

The four films here aren't really Broadway musicals, but rather movies that were (with one exception) based on material originally created for the Broadway stage. Show Boat was one of the earliest shows in the modern-musical era, and this 1951 adaptation (the third, following versions in 1929 and 1936) stars familiar MGM players Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and others in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Southern epic, featuring \"Ol' Man River,\" \"Can't Help Loving That Man of Mine,\" and more. Annie Get Your Gun (1950) stars Bettie Hutton (in a role intended for Judy Garland) as a spunky Western gal who gives Howard Keel all he can handle, and features such Irving Berlin standards as \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" \"Anything You Can Do,\" and \"Doin' What Comes Naturally.\" Grayson and Keel return again in Kiss Me Kate (1953), as life imitates art in a production of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew , and the Cole Porter songs include \"Wunderbar\" and \"So in Love.\" The exception is Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), one of MGM's greatest original creations that was itself adapted for the stage years later.

And with the Cold War in full effect, there are plenty of Eastern bloc operatives with dodgy accents to keep them busy. The year begins with a two-parter in which Stetson pretends to fall for a Soviet spy, but when the plan backfires, Amanda has to prove that he hasn't been \"playing footsie with the Russians,\" as their boss, Billy (Mel Stewart), puts it. Once they put that business behind them, Lee proposes, and the two make (secret) plans for the future. After awhile, though, Amanda's mother, Dotty (Beverly Garland, delightful as ever), and others start to catch on. In the meantime, Lee receives damning information about his late parents, who also worked in intelligence, and sets out to clear their names (Jackson directed this episode, which features film noir-like flashbacks starring Wendie Malick). Other cases involve terrorists, kidnappers, art thieves, shady toy manufacturers, and Dotty's gambling-addicted boyfriend (though the actors who play Amanda's sons still appear in the credits, they garner minimal screen time). In the process, evildoers poison Lee, shoot Amanda, and manipulate Billy's memories in scenarios involving familiar faces like Dennis Haysbert and Blair Underwood. If Francine (Martha Smith) assists with most operations, Dr. Smyth (Myron Natwick) hinders more than he helps--Lee describes his high-blown speech as \"verbal fruit salad.\" Due to Jackson's health problems, which contributed to the show's demise, Smith fills in for the final three episodes. In retrospect, Scarecrow and Mrs. King was a sweet, sincere series that shares much of the same romantic appeal as Remington Steele . --Kathleen C.

Thanks-------Item title: Scarecrow & Mrs. King: Season 4  Item description: Product Description Scarecrow and Mrs. King: The Complete Fourth Season A single mother in suburban Washington D.C. discovers she has a talent for espionage work when she meets a dashing undercover agent--but balancing her duties as a spy with her responsibility as a parent proves constantly entertaining in this romantic-adventure series. ]]> Amazon.com By their final season, Amanda King (Kate Jackson), a mother of two, and Lee \"Scarecrow\" Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner), a former ladies' man, had become Agency colleagues, but they continue to keep their relationship under wraps--otherwise, they wouldn't be able to catch the bad guys. And with the Cold War in full effect, there are plenty of Eastern bloc operatives with dodgy accents to keep them busy. The year begins with a two-parter in which Stetson pretends to fall for a Soviet spy, but when the plan backfires, Amanda has to prove that he hasn't been \"playing footsie with the Russians,\" as their boss, Billy (Mel Stewart), puts it. Once they put that business behind them, Lee proposes, and the two make (secret) plans for the future. After awhile, though, Amanda's mother, Dotty (Beverly Garland, delightful as ever), and others start to catch on. In the meantime, Lee receives damning information about his late parents, who also worked in intelligence, and sets out to clear their names (Jackson directed this episode, which features film noir-like flashbacks starring Wendie Malick). Other cases involve terrorists, kidnappers, art thieves, shady toy manufacturers, and Dotty's gambling-addicted boyfriend (though the actors who play Amanda's sons still appear in the credits, they garner minimal screen time). In the process, evildoers poison Lee, shoot Amanda, and manipulate Billy's memories in scenarios involving familiar faces like Dennis Haysbert and Blair Underwood. If Francine (Martha Smith) assists with most operations, Dr. Smyth (Myron Natwick) hinders more than he helps--Lee describes his high-blown speech as \"verbal fruit salad.\" Due to Jackson's health problems, which contributed to the show's demise, Smith fills in for the final three episodes. In retrospect, Scarecrow and Mrs. King was a sweet, sincere series that shares much of the same romantic appeal as Remington Steele . --Kathleen C. Fennessy  rating: 5.0  review: Great service and product. Really enjoyable.

All he asks is that his handpicked squad of 10 grifters and cons play the game like they have nothing to lose. If all goes right, the payoff will be a fat $150 million. Oceans 12 (2004) They're back. And then some. Twelve is the new eleven when Danny Ocean and pals return in a sequel to the cool caper that saw them pull off a $160 million heist. But $160 million doesn't go as far as it used to. It's time to pull off another stunner of a plan. Exciting locations include Amsterdam, Paris and Rome, the direction again of Steven Soderbergh and the original cast plus Catherine Zeta Jones and others. Oceans 13 (2007) Danny Ocean rounds up the boys for the most dazzling heist yet, after casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double-crosses one of the eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould). George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and more re-team with director Steven Soderbergh for a split-second caper that stacks the deck with wit, style and cool.",
